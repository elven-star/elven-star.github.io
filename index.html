<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Kris wrapped his black cloak firmly on his torso and gave his room a final look before he left for the day. <em>Everything is in order</em>, he thought to himself a he looked at his dimly lit room. He picked his staff with one hand and his flute with his other and walked towards the door.</p>
<p>Outside the morning mist had veiled the village in darkness and a gentle breeze sent shivers down his spine. Kris tucked the flute in his pocket and the rested the staff against his leg and rubbed his hands together. <em>Where is she?</em> he thought to himself.</p>
<p>A figure moved in the mist and Kris turned to see Freya walking towards him with her bright red lips curved in a smile and her blood red eyes glistening with joy, “Good Morning!” she slapped his back.</p>
<p>“You are always late!” Kris said, picking up his staff and walked towards the east, “Even when you plan the day yourself!” Freya had come over late last night with a devious smile on her face and had asked Kris to get up early and get his flute with him.</p>
<p>“So?” Freya shrugged as she skipped forward next to him, “A Woman is always fashionably late!”</p>
<p>“A woman doesn’t skip around!” Kris said sharply.</p>
<p>“Why do you carry that staff,” Freya took the staff from him and examined it, “Like an old man?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a walking cane,” Kris took it back from her before Freya could see the inscribing at the hilt, “It’s a weapon!”</p>
<p>Freya narrowed her eyes, “That weapon cannot kill anyone!” she said as the two winded down the only road leading into the village.</p>
<p>“Not all weapons are meant to kill,” Kris said with a sorrow buried deep inside him, “Some are meant to defend!”</p>
<p>The sun had broken over the horizon and the morning mist disappeared, revealing a small village behind it’s veil. The village had grown like a fungus since Kris had settled a long time ago, <em>How long was it since I came here?</em> he thought to himself, <em>I shouldn’t forget who I am!</em></p>
<p>“Let’s move quickly,” Kris held Freya’s hand and led her down the road. Freya blushed next to him and fell silent. Kris let her hand go once they were outside the village limits, “Didn’t want anyone to see us!” he said shuffling uncomfortably when he saw Freya blushing.</p>
<p>“Okay!” she replied with an adoring smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s get this day over with!” Kris said as he waited for Freya to lead the way.</p>
<p>“What’s the hurry!” Freya put her hands on her hips and frowned.</p>
<p>“Anna doesn’t know!” Kris said scratching his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry!” Freya said, “I’ve told your baby sister, you’ll be away! She’s a grown woman Kris!”</p>
<p>Kris fondly remembered her mischievous baby sister and smiled to himself, “Yes, she’s grown a lot!”</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Freya led the way and turned North.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sun was peaking over the horizon above the mountains in the east and warmed the chilly glacial winds. Freya, took off her coat and continued to hike in the ankle deep snow with ease. “Aren’t you cold?” Kris asked as he followed in step behind Freya. He had tied his quarter staff across his back.</p>
<p>Freya turned around with a skip in her feet, “It’s so pleasant right now!” Kris saw her cheeks flush pink and her lips curved in a smile and he looked away quickly, <em>She’s beautiful….</em> Kris thought as he continued to follow her.</p>
<p><em>No.</em> Kris thought internally, <em>Don’t get too close.</em> A distant memory flashed in his eyes and he collided with Freya, his face sinking right into her breasts, “Kris!” Freya blushed, “You can touch my bosom later!” she giggled and pointed around them, “We are here!”</p>
<p>Kris, shook his head, and buried the painful memory, and looked around. A waterfall escaped from the glacier and filled the atmosphere around them with cackling. Birds chirpped in the green trees that withstood the extreme cold of the Mountains. A mountain lion, stalked them with careful eyes and drank from the stream of water. Kris smiled and turned to Freya who stood with her head raised high with pride and her hands on her hips, “Happy Birthday Kris!”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Kris raised an eyebrow in confusion, “Birthday? Today’s not my Birthday!”</p>
<p>“Well,” Freya looked embarassed, she held his callused hands in hers, “It is for me! ten years ago, on this day, you walked into my life. Or rather, I walked into your life. Ever since, I’ve been the happiest version of myself!” Freya bent and pulled out a dagger from a sheath she had attached to her ankle, “So, as a gift, I’ll cook a delicious meal from a game that I catch, on a fire I build.”</p>
<p>“You are terrible at hunting,” Kris gave out a throaty laugh, “And burning everything to the ground is your idea of starting a fire!” Kris pulled out a small knife from somewhere in his jacket to help Freya.</p>
<p>She placed a hand on his chest and glared, “Sit!” she ordered. Kris shrugged and tucked the knife away. Freya inhaled, calmed herself and stalked off towards thee base of the waterfall and disappeared from sight. <em>Alone, again!</em> Kris exhaled sharply took his staff off his back. He undid his cloak and stretched his muscles. After a while, he took his staff that was jutting from the ground and moved it in smooth, large circles in front of him. He slowly worked his upper body and was covered in a thin layer of sweat. His shirt stuck to his chest and revealed a muscular frame underneath.</p>
<p>He breathed in methodically and began working on his footwork. Slowly taking two steps forward and swinging he back leg in a high kick. <em>Hmm.</em> he let out some air as he performed a combo of slow circles an a high kick. He repeated that motion a few hundred times roughing up the snow underneath his feet. By the time Freya had returned with a small bird in her hands and big, wide grin on her lips, he was drenched and felt hot. Freya looked at him with beady eyes and smiled amorously as she lit a small fire in a pit that she had lined with stones.</p>
<p>“Who taught you all this?” Kris asked with awe, “You are not the only one who is a wilderness expert.” Freya poked at the fire to get it raging, “I was always an expert!”</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Kris said taking his shirt off and exposing his a heavily scarred torso. Cuts ran all along his chest and were sewed off hastily. Puncture wounds were filled by lump of skin. Freya eyed him with lust and awe, “You’ve been terrible everytime you followed me on a hunt!”</p>
<p>Freya didn’t answer, Kris noticed her cheeks flushing bright red and he quickly wrapped himself in his cloak, <em>No.</em> he thought as he struggled to keep his emotions that he had felt a long time ago and had learnt to avoid, in check. <em>She’s too delicate.</em> Kris looked at her skinning the bird, <em>But is she?</em></p>
<p>“Lunch!” Freya said, “Will be served in 5 minutes.” she looked at him smiled and sat next to him. <em>Too close. Don’t let her too close.</em> he thought as Freya rested her head on his shoulders.</p>
<hr />
<p>A mountain lion stalked closer to their little camp, following the smell of burning fat and Kris scared it away, “Even the mountain lion finds that delicious!” Kris pointed at the fire where the game slowly cooked with his staff. Freya blushed pink again and smiled. A loose strand of her brown hair had fallen on her face and she tucked it behind her ears. <em>She is beautiful…</em> Kris stopped the chain of thought and wiped a smile that wa forming on his lips, <em>No! It’ll only lead to pain.</em></p>
<p>Freya poked at the lump of meat that had turned black, “It’s done.” she said as she pulled out at one of the bones and ripped the meat free and handed it to Kris. He blowed some air to cool the meat down and dug his teeth into it. A storm of flavor hit his tongue and his smiled with statisfaction, “Wow.” he said eating mouthful at a time, “This tastes amazing. I can feel the taste of crushed herbs in the fat…” he took another bite, “Pepper seasoning? where did you find pepper?” he didn’t wait as he continued to take bite after bite, “Do taste turmeric and ginger?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Freya said blushing pink.</p>
<p>“Where did you find these exotic herbs?”</p>
<p>Freya tucked the unruly strand back again and raised her head in pride, “I went to Moonspire!”</p>
<p>“Alone?” his eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Kris looked at her with new found respect and gave her a little salute. “You are bold.” he praised her and continued to eat into the meat.</p>
<p>By the time Kris had swallowed his last morsel, Freya was already on her feet and extinguishing the fire. She produced her hand and pulled Kris to his feet, “So now what?” he said hanging his staff across his back and stretching. He burpped a litle and massaged his belly, “I don’t remember the last time I’ve had such delicious meal!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know!” Freya said turning n her heels, “Let’s go!” She looked up at the sun that had cresended marking that the day was half over. <em>Hmm!</em> Kris thought, <em>Time flies when she’s around.</em> Kris followed skipping Freya with a smile, his heart skipped a beat seeing her rugged form, <em>This path… This path will lead to sorrow and…</em></p>
<p>Kris buried his thought and followed Freya’s steps. The peaks of Snowall mountains glittered in the yellow sun. Gentle, icy breeze flew from the east and the two continued to hike through the snowy terrain of the Snowdale Plateau. “Freya!” Kris said as he continued to follow the woman.</p>
<p>“Yes?” She spun around with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” he looked up at the sky and noticed that sun was beginning it’s descent, “It’ll be dark in a couple of hours!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Freya said as continued to walk. Kris looked around to get the bearing and realised they were circling the village and moving westwards. A few miles later Freya stopped dead and turned around with a smile, she was blushing red.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember this place?” Kris looked around and found himself in the woods. Gigantic trees jutted towards the sky and covered the small glade in darkness. Right behind Freya, a hollow tree twisted towards the sky.</p>
<p>“No!” Kris said with confusion as he tried to find the glade in his memories, “I don’t remember this place.”</p>
<p>“Kris,” Freya said softly as she grabbed his callused hands in her soft ones. She guided him towards the hollowed tree, “This is where we first met!” she said as she led him inside the hollow. A beam of sunlight entered from the top of the hollow and illuminated it. Kris found a thin sheet spread on the ground and a bottle of red liquid sitting in the corner.</p>
<p>“Sit!” she said. His heart skipped a beat or two and he felt emotions that he had not felt in a long time. <em>This will lead to disaster.</em> he thought, <em>Don’t…</em> he said as he sat on the sheet next to her.</p>
<p>“Play that flute!” Freya said pouring a glass of wine for herself.</p>
<p>Kris put his hands inside his coat and produced the metal flute. <em>Don’t… It’ll lead to death…</em> he tried to stop himself from being there. He found himself moving the flute towards his lips, a heartbeat later, a melody poured from his lips and the forest turned still. Everything stopped around as a melancholic melody slowly unfolded. His flute lamented his past, the deaths.</p>
<p>The notes carried the sorrow and anger. His fingers moved swiftly on the flute and heartbreaking music continued to pour. A teardrop formed in his eyes as he his past flashed in front of his eyes. Freya wiped the teardrop from his eyes and placed a hand on his. He stopped.</p>
<p>She embraced his head between her bosom and he melted. A sorrow that Kris had struggled to keep away stormed inside him. He hugged her, and before he could control, they kissed.</p>
<p>“No!” Kris said, suddenly pulling free.</p>
<p>“What happened!”</p>
<p>“Nothing can ever happen between us!” Kris said.</p>
<p>“Why?” Freya asked embarassed.</p>
<p>Kris didn’t answer for a moment, “Because…” he couldn’t explain it to her, so he kissed her lips one more time, “I’m not what you think I’m.” he finally said.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Freya asked.</p>
<p>“Freya…” Kris looked at her with pleading eyes.</p>
<p>“Okay.” she said, “It’s about to get dark. Let’s get going.” she didn’t push him further. <em>She’s strong, she’s brave, she’s sweet, she’s understanding. Kris, maybe finally you can be happy. Maybe this time love won’t lead to anything bad.</em></p>

On the way home, Kris is attacked by Brigands and he breaks their bones This shows his physical strength as he beats a group of 6 brigands with just his staff -->
<p><em>She’s perfect…</em> Kris stared at the blank ceiling. Freya’s red eyes glittered in back of his head, <em>They are the most beautiful eyes I’ve every seen.</em> he thought as he tossed around on the floor. A cold wind entered through the window. Kris got to his feet and stretched. His scars stretched as he moved, <em>No.</em> he thought. He pulled his cloak and wrapped it around his scarred chest and grabbed his staff on his way out. The a horned moon hung low in the sky and owls hooted eerily. Far in the north Kris could see light shooting in the sky and illuminating a passing cloud.</p>
<p><em>Love will destroy you Kris.</em> he thought as he practiced swinging the staff over his head. He snaked through the deserted roads of the Snowdale suffering his past alone, <em>Everytime you’ve loved someone…</em> face of a woman from his past flashed and Kris stopped. He shook his head and made a hard left and continued to walk till he reached a small, but embellished building. He looked around and found himself alone, <em>Alone.</em> he thought, <em>Bury yourself in your work Kris. Love isn’t for you.</em> he unlocked the door and entered the building.</p>
<p>Once inside, he flicked his fingers and the lamps in the room burned brightly, <em>Hmm.</em> he smiled. He moved around the room and placed his staff right over the fireplace. He flicked his fingers together and a bright fire cackled and slowly warmed the room. He looked around with a smile, once satisfied he took his place behind a mahgony table and started flipping through parchments. <em>Let’s see.</em> he shuffled a huge stack of parchment and buried himself in the content and before he could notice, Freya’s beautiful face went into the background.</p>
<p>Kris yawned, <em>I need to go to Moonspire soon!</em> he thought as he looked out of the window, <em>Duke’s trying to scam me.</em> he thought. He took the parchement from his desk and turned to the filing cabinet. When he opened the door a bucket fell on his head. <em>Anna.</em> he thought shoving the stack in the filing cabinet. <em>Someone could get hurt.</em> he thought picking up the bucket and placing it in a corner.</p>
<p><em>Anna,</em> he thought, <em>Stop pulling such pranks.</em> he sighed when instead of ink he found it filled with water. Outside the sky had turned purple and Kris heard chattering and hearty laughter. He pulled himself free from the desk and looked outside.</p>
<p>A group– of different races– passed by sharing a cigarette. <em>The miners are returning.</em> he thought. He looked at their happy faces and felt proud of what he had accomplished. A bulky orc noticed him and waved. Kris smiled and saluted the passing miner.</p>
<p>“Good Morning Kris.” an old, hairy man said as he puffed smoke in front of him.</p>
<p>“Good Morning Stefan.” he waved his bulky hand, “How was your shift?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Stefan pulled on a drag, “Pretty routine.”</p>
<p>“Good!” Kris turned on his heels and was greeted by a glass of water thrown at him. When he opened his eyes he saw Anna’s laughing figure dashing out of the door. <em>Anna.</em> he thought with a smile. He grabbed his cloak and his staff and exited the building.</p>
<p>“Kris.” an old woman fell at his feet just as he walked outside.</p>
<p>“What is it, Jaana?” he held the old woman by her shoulders, raised her to her feet and embraced her in a tight, warm hug.</p>
<p>“Kris…” words choked, “Kris… my son…” tears rolled down her eyes, “My son Arnar… he ran away.” she sniffled, “He ran away with all the money I had saved.” Kris kissed he old woman’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we’ll find him.” He looked around and saw Joan passing by. She was carried a small baton in her hand and her uniform was well ironed. He waved at her and she jogged towards him.</p>
<p>“Joan,” Kris spoke to her, still holding Jaana in an warm embrace, “Arnar has run away.” he said solemnly, “Find him.” He looked at Jaana’s tearful eyes and wiped them, “Take her home!”</p>
<p>“Come Jaana.” Joan said in a consoling voice and led Jaana through the twisting, maze-like roads of Snowdale. Kris sighed and continued to walk North from where miners were entering the town. The miners smiled and waved and shared small conversations as he continued to walk down the road, his cloak wrapped tightly on his shoulders and his staff hung across his back. He dug his flute out and played a cheerful melody for the passing miners. <em>This is what I could have accomplished in the past.</em> he thought with a heavy heart.</p>
<hr />
<p>The horizon to his right had turned orange and slowly pushed the purple of the sky away. The stream of miners continued to trickle down and finally he was the only one walking along the path. He looked around his sides and sighed, <em>Alone again.</em> he thought.</p>
<p>“Kris!” Someone called and pushed the sadness in his heart away. He turned around on his heels and saw Freya running towards him. She wore a white shirt that was covered by a thick black woolen jacket and a khaki pants and had tied her locks of brown hair in a ponytail that bounced side-to-side. Kris’ found himself smiling and his heart skipping inside. <em>This will destroy you.</em> he thought and tried to put away the bubbling emotions.</p>
<p>“Freya?” he said as she was within audible zone, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“I was going to the mountains!” she said pointing towards a ice covered peak somewhere northeast, “Anna told me she found a new plant that she hasn’t seen before. I was curious!” Freya paused and eyed him curiously, “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To the mines!” Kris said as he turned around and continued his march towards the mines.</p>
<p>“Something wrong!”</p>
<p>“Always good to keep a check…” Kris said over his shoulders, “Vumirium has become increasingly popular and expensive! Someone could steal it…” <em>Someone could misuse it.</em> Kris thought, <em>Someone could… No that isn’t possible.</em> “Vumirium is what keeps Snowdale safe, and well fed, Freya, I need to keep it safe.”</p>
<p>Freya continued besides him, their hands rubbed slightly and Kris’ mind froze, “You have to take care of so many things. Sounds like a tough life.” She momentarily held his hand in hers. Kris looked at her from the corner of his eyes and saw her blushing pink and smiling. A lock of hair had escaped the tie and had fallen across her face.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you getting late?” Kris finally said, his heart was dancing around in his heart.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Freya looked at him with a smile on her face, let go of hands and dashed away towards the mountain where Anna had claimed she found a new plant. <em>Did she really?</em> Kris thought.</p>
<p>Kris sighed and pulled the staff free from it’s harness and swung it over his head. He marched towards the mine– using the staff as a walking stick–= with a heaart filled with sour emotions, <em>You are marching towards your doom.</em> he thought when Freya’s smiling face flashed in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Kris stood in front of a metallic gate sharp trident shaped grilled. A guard stood sentry behind the locked metallic gate with a heavy baton in his hand a cigarette between his lips. Kris slapped the staff on his back and folded his arms behind and cleared his throat to get guard’s attention.</p>
<p>“Sir!” the guard gave him a crisp salute and unlocked the gate. Kris looked up at his name carved over the gate and shook his head, <em>I want people forget about me.</em> He walked straight towards the only building on the ground. He could hear hammer hitting the chisel and miners laughing and chatting while they worked. He could feel the heat from the open furnace where a group of metallurgists carefully processed the ore into ingots.</p>
<p>A few miners were outside the mining shaft and smoked cigarettes with their buddies the waved at Kris and lowered that hats in respect, “Good to see you here Kris.”</p>
<p>Kris smiled at them and entered the stone building. Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing and saluted. Kris nodded and they went back to what they were doing, <em>They respect me…</em> Kris thought as he walked towards the superintendent’s office and threw the door open.</p>
<p>Kris walked across the room and grabbed the superintendent by his throat and lifted him off his feet, “Tell me everything!” Kris ordered in flat, icy cold voice. The superintendent gasped for air tried to pull Kris’ fingers off. Outside the employees were looking through the door, shocked at Kris’ behaviour. Some shuffled nervously and others held their hands to their mouths.</p>
<p>“Tell me, why were you stealing Vumirium ore and selling it off in black market?”</p>
<p>“They…” the superintendent tried to say something but his words choked. Kris released his grip and the superintendent crashed to his knees, “They… They were giving me money and women.”</p>
<p>“Who are They?” Kris said pulling the flute from his jacket and placing the cold metal on his lips. He played a slow, heavy lament. The music sank everyone’s spirit Kris leaned on the edge of the table and waited for the superintendent. Kris paused and asked again, “Who are They?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. They nver showed themselves. I’d deliver the vumirium ingots and they’d send over the payment with a woman.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Kris ran his hands through the superintendent’s thick black hair. He looked outside through the open door. The employees, the citizens of Snowdale looked at him shock, “Vumirium is people of Snowdale’s property. This…” Kris bent down with flute in his hand, “Is your punishment.” Kris stabbed the flute straight through the superintendent’s throat and across the other side. He twitched in pain, blood gurgled through his throat and his mouth. Everyone outside gasped in horror, a few retched.</p>
<p>Kris pulled out the flute from the throat and calmly looked at everyone in the office, “No one steals. Get back to work now.” he said calmly and left the room.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kris couldn’t sleep the superintendent’s face haunted him. <em>What was his name?</em> Kris thought as he folded his hands to say a prayer, <em>Who are you praying to?</em> he thought, <em>Lord Vumir?</em> he laughed out loud and tossed around in his bed. His face flashed again. He wasn’t alone this time. Kris saw faces from his past, faces he thought he had forgotten.</p>
<p>“Ugh.” he sighed loudly and got up to his feet, <em>How many days since I slept?</em> he thought as he poured himself some water. <em>Where ever I go…</em> he thought looking out of the window. The moon was hanging low in the sky and illuminated the village. The candles filtered in the houses across and Kris could hear people whisper. He felt a strange, unsettling feeling in his stomach, <em>What is this feeling?</em> Kris thought. <em>I shouldn’t have killed the superintendent. I could have found a less severe, a less final punishment.</em> he felt guilt wash him over.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I need some fresh air?</em> he thought. <em>Maybe I need Freya?</em> Kris felt his eyes go wide and a chill running through his body, <em>Get that thought out. Freya is wrecking ball.</em> he steeled his nerves and grabbed his cloak on the way out. A chilling wind blew from the glaciers and the hair on his naked torso prickled. He quickly wrapped the cloak around his scarred chest and marched through the street with his staff by his side.</p>
<p>The wind gushed through the streets and roughened his shoulder length hair. Kris pulled cloak tighter and straightened the collar and continued to wander aimlessly through the silent street. <em>I shouldn’t have killed him.</em> he thought again. His slowly drifted towards the southern part of the village. <em>Why do I care if Vumirium is stolen and sold…</em> Kris thought, <em>No one knows…</em> he left farthest reaches of the village and continued to walk on a beaten down path.</p>
<p>When he stopped, he found himself standing in a glade left behind when the massive tree had died. Kris found a stub and sat on it. He searched for his flute in his cloak and pulled it out. He looked at it with dark eyes and broke into tears, <em>More deaths.</em> he thought, <em>Why did I kill him?</em> he thought. He tried to bend the flute with his raw strength but quickly realized his mistake.</p>
<p>A twig cracked and Kris quickly wiped his tears with one hand and flung the flute away to grab his staff, “Who is it?” Kris asked getting into a defensive stance. Kris calmed himself and heard footsteps approaching. He relaxed his muscles and prepared himself for a quick, brutal fight.</p>
<p>“Kris.” A young woman with skin as brown as Freya’s hair walked into the glade.</p>
<p>“Anna.” Kris lowered his staff and sat on the stub, “What are you doing here?” he mindlessly picked up the flute and cleaned it up with snow.</p>
<p>“I saw you walk aimlessly through the village.”</p>
<p>Kris tried to keep the tears at bay, “Yes, I couldn’t sleep.” Anna walked across and sat next to him on the stub. She wrapped her arms around his neck and gave him a hug.</p>
<p>“Anna,” Kris finally broke into tears, “I shouldn’t have killed him. I shouldn’t have killed them.”</p>
<p>“Them?”</p>
<p>Kris didn’t reply, his words choked in his throat and a stream of tears ran down his cheeks. Anna wiped them with her hands and hugged him, “He deserved it!” Anna said in soothing voice.</p>
<p>“Does he?” Kris sobbed, “No one deserves death Anna.” Kris managed to say.</p>
<p>“He stole from the mines!”</p>
<p>“A few ingots sold in the black market isn’t worth someone’s life.” Kris said. “A few ingots of Vumirium of in right hands could wreck havoc…” he thought.</p>
<p>“Wreck havoc?” Anna asked. Kris didn’t reply for a long time, and finally Anna gave up.</p>
<p>Kris didn’t say a word and slowly his eyes dried out and his sobbing stopped. Anna held him close and tight and kept caressing his head. Kris raised his head and smiled, “Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>He got to his feet and tucked the flute inside his cloak pockets and slapped the staff across his back. “No!” Anna said getting up to his feet and pulling the staff back, “You are carrying me back.” she handed the staff to him, “Following you is tiring.” Kris smiled and she piggybacked him. She planted a gentle kiss on his cheeks and they walked towards the village.</p>

 -->
<p><em>How long since I last slept?</em> Kris tried to recall last time he had a sound sleep, <em>Probably when I was in the office? Was I sleeping or was I lost in work?</em> Kris leaned against the window sill and allowed the icy, gentle breeze soothe him. <em>Should I go see Freya?</em> he fingered the flute, <em>What are you thinking.</em> Outside, Abos - the broken moon rose above horizon and bathed the snowy peaks of snowall mountains in a white glow.</p>
<p>“Kris!” someone knocked in a distinct pattern at his door and Kris smiled, “Open the damn door!”</p>
<p>Kris wrapped a shirt around his torso, pocketed his metallic flute and opened the door with a confused smile, “Freya,” he was glad to have some company, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Freya pushed him aside and dashed to the fireplace. Anna followed inside wearing her jet black hair in a bun and wrapped in a fur jacket that he had made himself, “Anna!” Kris hugged her and found Janna, Arnold and a few other miners smiling and shivering outside the door. He waved them inside and closed the door, “What are you guys doing here?” he wrapped his arm around Anna’s shoulders and leaned comfortably against her.</p>
<p>“We saw your lights on!” Freya said from near the fireplace, rubbing her hands together.</p>
<p>“I know you haven’t slept in fifteen days,” Anna said taking sip of a clear transparent liquid, “I thought you’d enjoy our company.” Kris looked at her with teary eyes, <em>She knows me so well.</em> he thought, “But mostly, we wanted to hear you play flute and maybe an interesting story.” Janna had pulled a chair and was sharing a cigarette with Arnold. The miners, Arnold’s friends, stared at Janna and elbowed each other playfully.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” Freya called out, “play your damn flute for your little Anna!”</p>
<p>“Oi.” Anna hugged Kris tightly, “Why are you taunting him?”</p>
<p>“He never does anything for me,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“Kris,” Janna said puffing cigarette in front of her, “Why Kris? Why don’t you do anything for Freya?”</p>
<p>“Yes Kris,” Arnold took the cigarette from Janna</p>
<p>“We know you love her!” Janna said winking. Kris looked at Freya and saw her cheeks turn scarlet, “You can’t stop…”</p>
<p>“Woah,” Kris pulled his hands up defensively– holding his flute, “I’ll do something for her as well. Do you want me to play the flute now?” he pressed the cold metal against his lips.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. Janna extinguished the cigarette with her heels and Freya put in more wood in the fire and it cackled against the comfortable silence in the room. Kris sighed and a sweet melody dripped from the flute. The small group moved side-to-side to the cresending melody. Anna took small sips from the bottle and passed it around. Kris moved his fingers slowly along the length and the soulful melody took a dark turn and swelled into a menacing medley. A tear formed in Arnold’s eyes and he wiped it off quickly before anyone could notice.</p>
<p>Kris kept his eyes from closing, <em>My past will comeback.</em> Freya tucked her brown hair behind her small ears and caught Kris staring at her. She blushed pink and looked away leaving a smile on his face, <em>Death will be hear soon.</em> When he finally stopped, Arnold couldn’t contain tears from bubbling in his eyes, Anna looked lost and Freya didn’t once look back at Kris after she caught him staring.</p>
<p>“That was beautiful.” Janna broke the silence and lit a cigarette, “You made Arnold cry.” she patted his back and laughed.</p>
<p>“Story time.” Anna said and everyone nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Kris said handing his flute to Anna who played with it as Kris thought for a good story to tell. He looked outside of the window and saw Broken pieces of Abos glowing brightly. “How about a story about Abos the Broken moon?”</p>
<p>“Sounds interesting to me.” Arnold said and Janna nodded. The miners looked away when Janna gave them a scathing glare.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ages ago, when the man had just discovered fire, when the continent was different Abos was a Powerful King of the Sky. He ruled the night and he ruled the day and everyone on the continent bent their knees in front of him. “Who can defeat?” he would often ask his wife Abisa – the daughter of the Sun. Abos sat on his throne looking down at the men who discovered fire and saw a young, virign woman walking through the forest with a stone knife in one hand and a basket of fruits in the other.</p>
<p>Enchanted by her beauty, Abos the King of the Sky, got up from his throne and descended the earth in a human form. He was tall, muscular, white and glowing, “What is your name?” he asked the virgin woman.</p>
<p>“Emira.” she said. Her eyes were dazed by his glowing form and she inched closer in fascination. Abos stood there with his arms on his hips and his chin raised in arrogance. When she approached he grabbed her by her waist and broke the scared promise he made to Abisa, his wife. He lay with Emira in the forest and made defiant love to her. The Sun saw Abos’ defiance and saw tears trickling down Abisa’s eyes.</p>
<p>When Abos returned to the sky, Abisa, accompanied by her father, entered Abos’ castle. Her eyes were swollen and her heart broken, “Why did you do this to me?” she asked, her words drowned in her tears, “Why did you break your scared promise?”</p>
<p>“Because,” Abos got to his feet and said in his hubris, “I can.”</p>
<p>Enraged by Abos’ pride the Sun raised his hands and casted him into a big spherical rock– the moon that we see at night.</p>
<p>“You laid with another,” Abisa said swinging her Hammer– the Ruin, “When I loved you with all my heart!” Tears that trickled down her eyes turned into Silver. She slammed Ruin on Abos’ smooth, spherical contours and shattered him into pieces.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill that woman.” Abisa said furious with jealousy and descended the Continent. And saw the Emira was dead, killed by Abos. From her belly, Abisa heard the cackling of a child. Using the knife that lay on the ground, Abisa ripped her belly and pulled a small, bronze skinned child whose eyes glowed golden just like Abos. She took the child to the Sky and raised him as her own. He came to be known as Vumir– the Son of Abisa.</p>
<hr />
<p>“I’m pretty sure that is not the story.” Janna said puffing another cigarette and passing it along to Arnold.</p>
<p>“Well,” Kris said stretching his leg, “That’s the original story, that’s how the old books have it.” he looked at Freya who rested her head on her knees and watched Kris with playfulness in her eyes. Kris smiled and Freya blushed scarlet.</p>
<p>“That was fun Kris!” Anna said hugging him. Kris wrapped his hand around Anna’s shoulders and held her close. He could feel her cheerfulness coursing through his veins he felt his sorrows wash away in her warmth.</p>
<p>“Now,” Kris said turning around and walking towards a small cabinet, “Let’s drink this fine wine.” he said pulling out a mud jar from the cabinet and carefully placing it in the center. Anna scavanged glasses for everyone from the kitchen and helped Kris pour wine for everyone. Kris found a nice spot close to the fire and smiled at Freya who delicately sipped wine from her glass.</p>
<p>Anna gossiped with Janna and teased the miners for oogling obstinately. She took the glass from Arnold’s hands and emptied it in a single gulp. Kris laughed at her cheerfulness, momentarily forgeting his past. He found Freya holding his callused hands and blushing pink. Kris smiled at her and gave her a soft hands a gentle squeeze. A slow, strained knock on the door, startled everyone. Anna dropped the glass of wine on the floor, spilling the white liquid. She got to her feet– almost angrily– and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Kris!” she let out a panicked welp and Kris let go of Freya’s soft hands and ran towards her. Outside Arnar, Joan’s son lay flat on the ground blood oozing from multiple cuts on his torso.</p>
<p>“They are coming.” he strained.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kris wiped his brow with back of his hand and concentrated on cleaning the blade wound. “Anna.” Kris said looking up to find Anna standing opposite him and watching Arnar with a tearful eye</p>
<p>“He’ll survive,” Anna asked with fear ladden voice, “Kris.”</p>
<p>Kris poured some more alcohol and dabbed the wound with a cloth that stained red, “He’ll.” he said and went to the fire place and placed his flute deep inside the clacking fire and returned to find Anna’s eyes dripping big tear drops down both the cheeks. He embraced the little girl and kissed her forehead, “You love him, right?”</p>
<p>Anna remained silent and Kris slowly led her out of the door, “Freya.” he called out and she dashed towards him, blushing scarlet, “Take care of Anna.” and closed the door behind.</p>
<p><em>Who are coming?</em> Kris thought as he stared at the fire dancing fire, <em>Why would someone attack Arnar?</em> Kris scratched his chin and wondered how Arnar had come stumbling to the village covered in multiple cuts on his torso. He glanced towards him and saw blood slowly oozing from the wounds. <em>He couldn’t be far from the village.</em> Kris turned to see his flute burning red hot. He grabbed the flute with his barehands, his skin sizzled and burned under the red hot flute.</p>
<p>He carefully cauterized Arnar’s wound who jolted conscious and screamed. Kris placed his free hand on Arnar’s mouth and supressed his agonizing pain, “What are you doing?” Anna flunged the door open and asked angrily, “You’ll kill him.” Kris ignored Anna’s protests and continued to cauterize Arnar’s wounds one by one. When done he threw the flute in a bucket filled with water and submerged his callused hands in the ice cold water.</p>
<p>“That,” Kris said wiping his hands on his trousers and walking towards Anna, “Will seal the open wounds and stop the blood loss.” He hugged Anna and guided her out of the door and into the snowy field. A cold wind had gathered speed and was blowing from the mountains. <em>She’ll get cold.</em> he thought as he hugged Anna in a tighter embrace.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you cold?” Janna asked pulling in a drag of smoke from the cigarette and shivering against the cold wind, “You are just wearing a shirt.” she pointed at his loose white shirt.</p>
<p>Kris smiled and ignored her, “Call Joan.” he ordered Janna who extinguished the butt of the cigarette and turned into an alley just a few steps away.</p>
<p>“Arnold,” he turned to find Arnold smoking a cigarette, “You call every officer here right now. Where did the miners go?”</p>
<p>“They went for a leak.” Arnold pointed to his back.</p>
<p>“We need to protect the mines,” Kris handed Anna to Freya and scratched his head, “We need to protect Snowdale.” <em>I cannot lose them.</em> he thought. “Everyone who can fight should be here within one hour.” Arnold nodded and left in Miners direction. Kris turned to Freya who was soothing a shocked Anna. <em>She looks so beautiful right now.</em></p>
<p>Kris started towards them when Arnar screamed in agony and Anna broke free and rushed inside.</p>
<p>“She’s in love with him.” Freya said holding Kris’ callused hands.</p>
<p><em>Everytime I fall in love.</em> Kris thought sighing, <em>Death follows.</em></p>

<p><em>This silence…</em> Kris thought looking towards Anna and Freya, <em>Please break this silence.</em> Over an hour had passed since Kris sent Arnold away. “Where’s Janna?” he spoke to himself to break the heavy silence that lingered in the room.</p>
<p>“She’ll be here.” Freya said warming herself next to the fireplace. She held Anna in a soothing embrace who hadn’t spoken a word. <em>What’s going inside her head?</em> Kris started towards her.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Kris said holding Anna by her shoulders, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Anna raised her gaze and smiled at Kris, “I’m fine.” she said taking the jacket off and handing it to Freya who felt a chill settle inside her, “If Arnar was attacked…” Anna thought for a moment, “The attackers should be close by.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Kris got to his feet and fingered the flute, “We need to protect the Deposits.”</p>
<p>“Do you think they are after the deposits?”</p>
<p>Kris looked outside the window and watched Abos make it’s final descent beyond the horizon, “Yes.” he said softly. <em>It’s the only valuable thing in this village.</em> he thought to himself, <em>How did they find our location?</em> Kris thought. <em>I’ve made sure the spies don’t find us.</em></p>
<p>“Kris.” Janna knocked loudly and broke Kris’ chain of thought.</p>
<p>“What to you so long?” Kris looked at stooped Joan covered in multiple layers of warm clothing following Janna with a walking stick and shrugged, “Get in. Quickly now.”</p>
<p>“How’s my son?” Joan asked trying to walk as fast as she could.</p>
<p>“He’s well.” Kris said lifting Joan in his arms and taking her to the Arnar. Joan fell on Arnar’s chest and broke down– sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“Why?” Joan said slapping Arnar across his face, “Why did you steal all the money?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to buy a staff.” Arnar said looking towards Kris with reverent eyes, “A staff just like Kris’s. I want to be as strong as he is.” <em>He worships me.</em> A stone churned inside his stomach and his heart fell heavier than a mountain, <em>He worships me like a hero… I’m no hero… I’m… a Murderer.</em> Darkness gathered inside his mind, and his voices of people long dead echoed.</p>
<p>Anna tapped his shoulders and Kris saw Arnold waiting next to Janna, smoking a cigarette and passing it back to her, “They are here.” he said pointing towards the door. Kris nodded and looked at Freya and centered himself in the present.</p>
<p>Kris found a small group of men and women armed with daggers and batons shivering in the morning cold. Kris scanned the men and made a note for himself, <em>I should have trained a few swordsmen…</em></p>
<p>“Why did you call us Kris?” a middle aged man with broad shoulders and matted hair said in rasping voice.</p>
<p>“A threat looms on Snowdale…” Kris paused, and searched for cautious words.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s almost winter,” a scar faced man said in a heavy voice, “It’s particularly chilly this time. We may not have enough harvest.”</p>
<p>“Silence.” Janna ordered from behind Kris. <em>I can always count on her to discipline them.</em></p>
<p>“A threat far greater than a cold winter.” Kris said, “A threat that can kill us. That can wreak havoc on the continent.”</p>
<p>“We don’t care about the continent.” someone said from behind, “We are the outcasts that no one wanted.”</p>
<p>“A broken continent would risk our existence.” Kris said calmly, “This threat would make us a target.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have to worry,” a old woman with a baton resting on her shoulders said, “You can protect us.”</p>
<p><em>These people…</em> thoughts of his bloody past tried to surface and Kris suppressed them, “We can prevent this…” Kris looked at Freya and her smiling face soothed his anxiety.</p>
<p>“What is this threat?”</p>
<p>“Arnar was attacked…” Kris said, "The attackers are close to the village, and they are no ordinary brigands, they are armed with sharp blades.</p>
<p>“We must protect the vumirium deposits and the mines. They should not be taken from us. It is ours and should remain that way.” <em>If Vumirium falls into wrong hands…</em> Kris shook his head lightly.</p>
<p>“What do you want us to do?” Janna asked from behind, shouldering her baton.</p>
<p>Kris nodded, “Janna, you and Arnold, take these soldiers and secure the Deposits.”</p>
<p>“You said the attackers are armed with blades…” Janna paused looking at her baton, “How can we fight them with…”</p>
<p>“Batons hold up against blades.” Kris went inside the room and returned with an unsheathed sword. Everyone exchanged looks and gasped at the shining blade, “Take your defensive stance…” Kris ordered Janna and he slashed his sword over his head and it slide against the smooth wood of baton.</p>
<p>“Batons are great for defense…” Kris said, "Mind your head and you’ll do just fine.</p>
<p>“I’ll need a scout who can signal us when the enemy is near, Kaylor…”</p>
<p>“No.” Freya said, “I’ll be the scout.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Kris raised an eyebrow. <em>She burns everything. She’s sloppy. Can she do it? Well she did hunt for you!</em></p>
<p>“Yes!” Freya said folding her arms under her bosom. Kris looked at her and nodded in approval.</p>
<p>“Everyone else… need to stay inside their houses.” <em>I cannot lose Anna.</em> “Anna you’ll come with me to the mines.”</p>
<p>“No.” Anna stood her ground, “I’ll stay with Arnar. He’ll need some protect.” Kris looked at her with raised eyebrow and saw Freya smiling from the corner of his eyes.</p>
<p><em>She’ll be okay.</em> Freya mouthed and Kris nodded and sheathed the blade and handed it to her, “Anna, this is a very special sword with a long history. It has never lost a battle. Keep this with you, it’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>“Does it have a name?” Anna asked unsheathing the sword a little, “Why is special?”</p>
<p>“It’s called Sorrow.” Kris said placing a hand on her shoulders, “For your other question, you’ll have to wait till this is over.”</p>
<p>Kris turned around and dismissed everyone to their stations. Freya stood next to him holding his hands, “We’ll win this.” Freya said in soft, comforting voice. A single strand of her brown hair had gotten free form her braid and gently fell across her face. Kris looked at her over his shoulders and thought, <em>She looks so beautiful in the morning Sun. I’m definitely, hopelessly in love.</em> he shook his head and steeled himself, <em>Doom’s here.</em></p>

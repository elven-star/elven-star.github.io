## Chapter 1

Kris wrapped his black cloak firmly on his torso and gave his room a final look
before he left for the day. *Everything is in order*, he thought to himself a
he looked at his dimly lit room. He picked his staff with one hand and his
flute with his other and walked towards the door. 

Outside the morning mist had veiled the village in darkness and a gentle breeze
sent shivers down his spine. Kris tucked the flute in his pocket and the rested
the staff against his leg and rubbed his hands together. *Where is she?* he
thought to himself. 

A figure moved in the mist and Kris turned to see Freya walking towards him
with her bright red lips curved in a smile and her blood red eyes glistening
with joy, "Good Morning!" she slapped his back.

"You are always late!" Kris said, picking up his staff and walked towards the
east, "Even when you plan the day yourself!" Freya had come over late last
night with a devious smile on her face and had asked Kris to get up early and
get his flute with him.

"So?" Freya shrugged as she skipped forward next to him, "A Woman is always
fashionably late!"

"A woman doesn't skip around!" Kris said sharply.

"Why do you carry that staff," Freya took the staff from him and examined it,
"Like an old man?"

"It's not a walking cane," Kris took it back from her before Freya could see
the inscribing at the hilt, "It's a weapon!"

Freya narrowed her eyes, "That weapon cannot kill anyone!" she said as the two
winded down the only road leading into the village.

"Not all weapons are meant to kill," Kris said with a sorrow buried deep inside
him, "Some are meant to defend!" 

The sun had broken over the horizon and the morning mist disappeared, revealing
a small village behind it's veil. The village had grown like a fungus since
Kris had settled a long time ago, *How long was it since I came here?* he
thought to himself, *I shouldn't forget who I am!* 

"Let's move quickly," Kris held Freya's hand and led her down the road. Freya
blushed next to him and fell silent. Kris let her hand go once they were
outside the village limits, "Didn't want anyone to see us!" he said shuffling
uncomfortably when he saw Freya blushing.

"Okay!" she replied with an adoring smile.

"Let's get this day over with!" Kris said as he waited for Freya to lead the
way.

"What's the hurry!" Freya put her hands on her hips and frowned.

"Anna doesn't know!" Kris said scratching his head. 

"Don't worry!" Freya said, "I've told your baby sister, you'll be away! She's a
grown woman Kris!"

Kris fondly remembered her mischievous baby sister and smiled to himself, "Yes,
she's grown a lot!" 

"Let's go!" Freya led the way and turned North.

---

Sun was peaking over the horizon above the mountains in the east and warmed the
chilly glacial winds. Freya, took off her coat and continued to hike in the
ankle deep snow with ease. "Aren't you cold?" Kris asked as he followed in step
behind Freya. He had tied his quarter staff across his back.

Freya turned around with a skip in her feet, "It's so pleasant right now!" Kris
saw her cheeks flush pink and her lips curved in a smile and he looked away
quickly, *She's beautiful....* Kris thought as he continued to follow her.

*No.* Kris thought internally, *Don't get too close.* A distant memory flashed
in his eyes and he collided with Freya, his face sinking right into her
breasts, "Kris!" Freya blushed, "You can touch my bosom later!" she giggled and
pointed around them, "We are here!"

Kris, shook his head, and buried the painful memory, and looked around. A
waterfall escaped from the glacier and filled the atmosphere around them with
cackling. Birds chirpped in the green trees that withstood the extreme cold of
the Mountains. A mountain lion, stalked them with careful eyes and drank from
the stream of water. Kris smiled and turned to Freya who stood with her head
raised high with pride and her hands on her hips, "Happy Birthday Kris!"

"Huh?" Kris raised an eyebrow in confusion, "Birthday? Today's not my
Birthday!"

"Well," Freya looked embarassed, she held his callused hands in hers, "It is
for me! ten years ago, on this day, you walked into my life. Or rather, I
walked into your life. Ever since, I've been the happiest version of myself!"
Freya bent and pulled out a dagger from a sheath she had attached to her ankle,
"So, as a gift, I'll cook a delicious meal from a game that I catch, on a fire
I build."

"You are terrible at hunting," Kris gave out a throaty laugh, "And burning
everything to the ground is your idea of starting a fire!" Kris pulled out a
small knife from somewhere in his jacket to help Freya.

She placed a hand on his chest and glared, "Sit!" she ordered. Kris shrugged
and tucked the knife away. Freya inhaled, calmed herself and stalked off
towards thee base of the waterfall and disappeared from sight. *Alone, again!*
Kris exhaled sharply took his staff off his back. He undid his cloak and
stretched his muscles. After a while, he took his staff that was jutting from
the ground and moved it in smooth, large circles in front of him. He slowly
worked his upper body and was covered in a thin layer of sweat. His shirt stuck
to his chest and revealed a muscular frame underneath.

He breathed in methodically and began working on his footwork. Slowly taking
two steps forward and swinging he back leg in a high kick. *Hmm.* he let out
some air as he performed a combo of slow circles an a high kick. He repeated
that motion a few hundred times roughing up the snow underneath his feet. By
the time Freya had returned with a small bird in her hands and big, wide grin
on her lips, he was drenched and felt hot. Freya looked at him with beady eyes
and smiled amorously as she lit a small fire in a pit that she had lined with
stones.

"Who taught you all this?" Kris asked with awe, "You are not the only one who
is a wilderness expert." Freya poked at the fire to get it raging, "I was
always an expert!" 

"Impossible!" Kris said taking his shirt off and exposing his a heavily scarred
torso. Cuts ran all along his chest and were sewed off hastily. Puncture wounds
were filled by lump of skin. Freya eyed him with lust and awe, "You've been
terrible everytime you followed me on a hunt!" 

Freya didn't answer, Kris noticed her cheeks flushing bright red and he quickly
wrapped himself in his cloak, *No.* he thought as he struggled to keep his
emotions that he had felt a long time ago and had learnt to avoid, in check.
*She's too delicate.* Kris looked at her skinning the bird, *But is she?* 

"Lunch!" Freya said, "Will be served in 5 minutes." she looked at him smiled
and sat next to him. *Too close. Don't let her too close.* he thought as Freya
rested her head on his shoulders.

---

A mountain lion stalked closer to their little camp, following the smell of
burning fat and Kris scared it away, "Even the mountain lion finds that
delicious!" Kris pointed at the fire where the game slowly cooked with his
staff. Freya blushed pink again and smiled. A loose strand of her brown hair
had fallen on her face and she tucked it behind her ears. *She is beautiful...*
Kris stopped the chain of thought and wiped a smile that wa forming on his
lips, *No! It'll only lead to pain.* 

Freya poked at the lump of meat that had turned black, "It's done." she said as
she pulled out at one of the bones and ripped the meat free and handed it to
Kris. He blowed some air to cool the meat down and dug his teeth into it. A
storm of flavor hit his tongue and his smiled with statisfaction, "Wow." he
said eating mouthful at a time, "This tastes amazing. I can feel the taste of
crushed herbs in the fat..." he took another bite, "Pepper seasoning? where did
you find pepper?" he didn't wait as he continued to take bite after bite, "Do
taste turmeric and ginger?"

"Yes!" Freya said blushing pink.

"Where did you find these exotic herbs?" 

Freya tucked the unruly strand back again and raised her head in pride, "I went
to Moonspire!"

"Alone?" his eyes widened.

"Yes!" Kris looked at her with new found respect and gave her a little salute.
"You are bold." he praised her and continued to eat into the meat.

By the time Kris had swallowed his last morsel, Freya was already on her feet
and extinguishing the fire. She produced her hand and pulled Kris to his feet,
"So now what?" he said hanging his staff across his back and stretching. He
burpped a litle and massaged his belly, "I don't remember the last time I've
had such delicious meal!"

"Yes, I know!" Freya said turning n her heels, "Let's go!" She looked up at the
sun that had cresended marking that the day was half over. *Hmm!* Kris thought,
*Time flies when she's around.* Kris followed skipping Freya with a smile, his
heart skipped a beat seeing her rugged form, *This path... This path will lead
to sorrow and...*

Kris buried his thought and followed Freya's steps. The peaks of Snowall
mountains glittered in the yellow sun. Gentle, icy breeze flew from the east
and the two continued to hike through the snowy terrain of the Snowdale
Plateau. "Freya!" Kris said as he continued to follow the woman.

"Yes?" She spun around with a smile on her face.

"Where are we going?" he looked up at the sky and noticed that sun was
beginning it's descent, "It'll be dark in a couple of hours!" 

"Yes!" Freya said as continued to walk. Kris looked around to get the bearing
and realised they were circling the village and moving westwards. A few miles
later Freya stopped dead and turned around with a smile, she was blushing red.

"What?"

"Don't you remember this place?" Kris looked around and found himself in the
woods. Gigantic trees jutted towards the sky and covered the small glade in
darkness. Right behind Freya, a hollow tree twisted towards the sky.

"No!" Kris said with confusion as he tried to find the glade in his memories,
"I don't remember this place."

"Kris," Freya said softly as she grabbed his callused hands in her soft ones.
She guided him towards the hollowed tree, "This is where we first met!" she
said as she led him inside the hollow. A beam of sunlight entered from the top
of the hollow and illuminated it. Kris found a thin sheet spread on the ground
and a bottle of red liquid sitting in the corner.

"Sit!" she said. His heart skipped a beat or two and he felt emotions that he
had not felt in a long time. *This will lead to disaster.* he thought,
*Don't...* he said as he sat on the sheet next to her.

"Play that flute!" Freya said pouring a glass of wine for herself.

Kris put his hands inside his coat and produced the metal flute. *Don't...
It'll lead to death...* he tried to stop himself from being there. He found
himself moving the flute towards his lips, a heartbeat later, a melody poured
from his lips and the forest turned still. Everything stopped around as a
melancholic melody slowly unfolded. His flute lamented his past, the deaths. 

The notes carried the sorrow and anger. His fingers moved swiftly on the flute
and heartbreaking music continued to pour. A teardrop formed in his eyes as he
his past flashed in front of his eyes. Freya wiped the teardrop from his eyes
and placed a hand on his. He stopped.

She embraced his head between her bosom and he melted. A sorrow that Kris had
struggled to keep away stormed inside him. He hugged her, and before he could
control, they kissed.

"No!" Kris said, suddenly pulling free.

"What happened!" 

"Nothing can ever happen between us!" Kris said.

"Why?" Freya asked embarassed. 

Kris didn't answer for a moment, "Because..." he couldn't explain it to her, so
he kissed her lips one more time, "I'm not what you think I'm." he finally
said.

"Who are you?" Freya asked.

"Freya..." Kris looked at her with pleading eyes.

"Okay." she said, "It's about to get dark. Let's get going." she didn't push
him further. *She's strong, she's brave, she's sweet, she's understanding.
Kris, maybe finally you can be happy. Maybe this time love won't lead to
anything bad.*

*She's perfect...* Kris stared at the blank ceiling. Freya's red eyes glittered
in back of his head, *They are the most beautiful eyes I've every seen.* he
thought as he tossed around on the floor. A cold wind entered through the
window. Kris got to his feet and stretched. His scars stretched as he moved,
*No.* he thought. He pulled his cloak and wrapped it around his scarred chest
and grabbed his staff on his way out. The a horned moon hung low in the sky and
owls hooted eerily. Far in the north Kris could see light shooting in the sky
and illuminating a passing cloud. 

*Love will destroy you Kris.* he thought as he practiced swinging the staff
over his head. He snaked through the deserted roads of the Snowdale suffering
his past alone, *Everytime you've loved someone...* face of a woman from his
past flashed and Kris stopped. He shook his head and made a hard left and
continued to walk till he reached a small, but embellished building. He looked
around and found himself alone, *Alone.* he thought, *Bury yourself in your
work Kris. Love isn't for you.* he unlocked the door and entered the building. 

Once inside, he flicked his fingers and the lamps in the room burned brightly,
*Hmm.* he smiled. He moved around the room and placed his staff right over the
fireplace. He flicked his fingers together and a bright fire cackled and slowly
warmed the room. He looked around with a smile, once satisfied he took his
place behind a mahgony table and started flipping through parchments. *Let's
see.* he shuffled a huge stack of parchment and buried himself in the content
and before he could notice, Freya's beautiful face went into the background. 

Kris yawned, *I need to go to Moonspire soon!* he thought as he looked out of
the window, *Duke's trying to scam me.* he thought. He took the parchement from
his desk and turned to the filing cabinet. When he opened the door a bucket
fell on his head. *Anna.* he thought shoving the stack in the filing cabinet.
*Someone could get hurt.* he thought picking up the bucket and placing it in a
corner.

*Anna,* he thought, *Stop pulling such pranks.* he sighed when instead of ink
he found it filled with water. Outside the sky had turned purple and Kris heard
chattering and hearty laughter. He pulled himself free from the desk and looked
outside. 

A group-- of different races-- passed by sharing a cigarette. *The miners are
returning.* he thought. He looked at their happy faces and felt proud of what
he had accomplished. A bulky orc noticed him and waved. Kris smiled and saluted
the passing miner. 

"Good Morning Kris." an old, hairy man said as he puffed smoke in front of him. 

"Good Morning Stefan." he waved his bulky hand, "How was your shift?" 

"Well," Stefan pulled on a drag, "Pretty routine."

"Good!" Kris turned on his heels and was greeted by a glass of water thrown at
him. When he opened his eyes he saw Anna's laughing figure dashing out of the
door. *Anna.* he thought with a smile. He grabbed his cloak and his staff and
exited the building.

"Kris." an old woman fell at his feet just as he walked outside.

"What is it, Jaana?" he held the old woman by her shoulders, raised her to her
feet and embraced her in a tight, warm hug.

"Kris..." words choked, "Kris... my son..." tears rolled down her eyes, "My son
Arnar... he ran away." she sniffled, "He ran away  with all the money I had
saved." Kris kissed he old woman's forehead.

"Don't worry, we'll find him." He looked around and saw Joan passing by. She
was carried a small baton in her hand and her uniform was well ironed. He waved
at her and she jogged towards him.

"Joan," Kris spoke to her, still holding Jaana in an warm embrace, "Arnar has
run away." he said solemnly, "Find him." He looked at Jaana's tearful eyes and
wiped them, "Take her home!"

"Come Jaana." Joan said in a consoling voice and led Jaana through the
twisting, maze-like roads of Snowdale. Kris sighed and continued to walk North
from where miners were entering the town. The miners smiled and waved and
shared small conversations as he continued to walk down the road, his cloak
wrapped tightly on his shoulders and his staff hung across his back. He dug his
flute out and played a cheerful melody for the passing miners. *This is what I
could have accomplished in the past.* he thought with a heavy heart.

---

The horizon to his right had turned orange and slowly pushed the purple of the
sky away. The stream of miners continued to trickle down and finally he was the
only one walking along the path. He looked around his sides and sighed, *Alone
again.* he thought. 

"Kris!" Someone called and pushed the sadness in his heart away. He turned
around on his heels and saw Freya running towards him. She wore a white shirt
that was covered by a thick black woolen jacket and a khaki pants and had tied
her locks of brown hair in a ponytail that bounced side-to-side. Kris' found
himself smiling and his heart skipping inside. *This will destroy you.* he
thought and tried to put away the bubbling emotions.

"Freya?" he said as she was within audible zone, "What are you doing here?"

"I was going to the mountains!" she said pointing towards a ice covered peak
somewhere northeast, "Anna told me she found a new plant that she hasn't seen
before. I was curious!" Freya paused and eyed him curiously, "Where are you
going?"

"To the mines!" Kris said as he turned around and continued his march towards
the mines.

"Something wrong!" 

"Always good to keep a check..." Kris said over his shoulders, "Vumirium has
become increasingly popular and expensive! Someone could steal it..." *Someone
could misuse it.* Kris thought, *Someone could... No that isn't possible.*
"Vumirium is what keeps Snowdale safe, and well fed, Freya, I need to keep it
safe." 

Freya continued besides him, their hands rubbed slightly and Kris' mind froze,
"You have to take care of so many things. Sounds like a tough life." She
momentarily held his hand in hers. Kris looked at her from the corner of his
eyes and saw her blushing pink and smiling. A lock of hair had escaped the tie
and had fallen across her face.

"Aren't you getting late?" Kris finally said, his heart was dancing around in
his heart.

"Yes." Freya looked at him with a smile on her face, let go of hands and dashed
away towards the mountain where Anna had claimed she found a new plant. *Did
she really?* Kris thought.

Kris sighed and pulled the staff free from it's harness and swung it over his
head. He marched towards the mine-- using the staff as a walking stick--= with
a heaart filled with sour emotions, *You are marching towards your doom.* he
thought when Freya's smiling face flashed in front of his eyes.

A few minutes later, Kris stood in front of a metallic gate sharp trident
shaped grilled. A guard stood sentry behind the locked metallic gate with a
heavy baton in his hand a cigarette between his lips. Kris slapped the staff on
his back and folded his arms behind and cleared his throat to get guard's
attention.

"Sir!" the guard gave him a crisp salute and unlocked the gate. Kris looked up
at his name carved over the gate and shook his head, *I want people forget
about me.*  He walked straight towards the only building on the ground. He
could hear hammer hitting the chisel and miners laughing and chatting while
they worked. He could feel the heat from the open furnace where a group of
metallurgists carefully processed the ore into ingots.

A few miners were outside the mining shaft and smoked cigarettes with their
buddies the waved at Kris and lowered that hats in respect, "Good to see you
here Kris."

Kris smiled at them and entered the stone building. Everyone in the room
stopped what they were doing and saluted. Kris nodded and they went back to
what they were doing, *They respect me...* Kris thought as he walked towards
the superintendent's office and threw the door open. 

Kris walked across the room and grabbed the superintendent by his throat and
lifted him off his feet, "Tell me everything!" Kris ordered in flat, icy cold
voice. The superintendent gasped for air tried to pull Kris' fingers off.
Outside the employees were looking through the door, shocked at Kris'
behaviour. Some shuffled nervously and others held their hands to their mouths.

"Tell me, why were you stealing Vumirium ore and selling it off in black
market?"

"They..." the superintendent tried to say something but his words choked. Kris
released his grip and the superintendent crashed to his knees, "They... They
were giving me money and women."

"Who are They?" Kris said pulling the flute from his jacket and placing the
cold metal on his lips. He played a slow, heavy lament. The music sank
everyone's spirit Kris leaned on the edge of the table and waited for the
superintendent. Kris paused and asked again, "Who are They?"

"I don't know. They nver showed themselves. I'd deliver the vumirium ingots and
they'd send over the payment with a woman."

"Hmm." Kris ran his hands through the superintendent's thick black hair. He
looked outside through the open door. The employees, the citizens of Snowdale
looked at him shock, "Vumirium is people of Snowdale's property. This..." Kris
bent down with flute in his hand, "Is your punishment." Kris stabbed the flute
straight through the superintendent's throat and across the other side. He
twitched in pain, blood gurgled through his throat and his mouth. Everyone
outside gasped in horror, a few retched. 

Kris pulled out the flute from the throat and calmly looked at everyone in the
office, "No one steals. Get back to work now." he said calmly and left the
room.

---

Kris couldn't sleep the superintendent's face haunted him. *What was his name?*
Kris thought as he folded his hands to say a prayer, *Who are you praying to?*
he thought, *Lord Vumir?* he laughed out loud and tossed around in his bed. His
face flashed again. He wasn't alone this time. Kris saw faces from his past,
faces he thought he had forgotten.

"Ugh." he sighed loudly and got up to his feet, *How many days since I slept?*
he thought as he poured himself some water. *Where ever I go...* he thought
looking out of the window. The moon was hanging low in the sky and illuminated
the village. The candles filtered in the houses across and Kris could hear
people whisper. He felt a strange, unsettling feeling in his stomach, *What is
this feeling?* Kris thought. *I shouldn't have killed the superintendent. I
could have found a less severe, a less final punishment.* he felt guilt wash
him over.

*Maybe I need some fresh air?* he thought. *Maybe I need Freya?* Kris felt his
eyes go wide and a chill running through his body, *Get that thought out. Freya
is wrecking ball.* he steeled his nerves and grabbed his cloak on the way out.
A chilling wind blew from the glaciers and the hair on his naked torso
prickled. He quickly wrapped the cloak around his scarred chest and marched
through the street with his staff by his side. 

The wind gushed through the streets and roughened his shoulder length hair.
Kris pulled cloak tighter and straightened the collar and continued to wander
aimlessly through the silent street. *I shouldn't have killed him.* he thought
again. His slowly drifted towards the southern part of the village. *Why do I
care if Vumirium is stolen and sold...* Kris thought, *No one knows...* he left
farthest reaches of the village and continued to walk on a beaten down path. 

When he stopped, he found himself standing in a glade left behind when the
massive tree had died. Kris found a stub and sat on it. He searched for his
flute in his cloak and pulled it out. He looked at it with dark eyes and broke
into tears, *More deaths.* he thought, *Why did I kill him?* he thought. He
tried to bend the flute with his raw strength but quickly realized his mistake. 

A twig cracked and Kris quickly wiped his tears with one hand and flung the
flute away to grab his staff, "Who is it?" Kris asked getting into a defensive
stance. Kris calmed himself and heard footsteps approaching. He relaxed his
muscles and prepared himself for a quick, brutal fight. 

"Kris." A young woman with skin as brown as Freya's hair walked into the glade. 

"Anna." Kris lowered his staff and sat on the stub, "What are you doing here?"
he mindlessly picked up the flute and cleaned it up with snow.

"I saw you walk aimlessly through the village." 

Kris tried to keep the tears at bay, "Yes, I couldn't sleep." Anna walked
across and sat next to him on the stub. She wrapped her arms around his neck
and gave him a hug.

"Anna," Kris finally broke into tears, "I shouldn't have killed him. I
shouldn't have killed them."

"Them?" 

Kris didn't reply, his words choked in his throat and a stream of tears ran
down his cheeks. Anna wiped them with her hands and hugged him, "He deserved
it!" Anna said in soothing voice.

"Does he?" Kris sobbed, "No one deserves death Anna." Kris managed to say. 

"He stole from the mines!"

"A few ingots sold in the black market isn't worth someone's life." Kris said.
"A few ingots of Vumirium of in right hands could wreck havoc..." he thought.

"Wreck havoc?" Anna asked. Kris didn't reply for a long time, and finally Anna
gave up.

Kris didn't say a word and slowly his eyes dried out and his sobbing stopped.
Anna held him close and tight and kept caressing his head. Kris raised his head
and smiled, "Let's go back."

He got to his feet and tucked the flute inside his cloak pockets and slapped
the staff across his back. "No!" Anna said getting up to his feet and pulling
the staff back, "You are carrying me back." she handed the staff to him,
"Following you is tiring." Kris smiled and she piggybacked him. She planted a
gentle kiss on his cheeks and they walked towards the village.

## Chapter 3

<!-- 

Part 1: Show Kris as a loved figure in Snowdale and how he loves everyone
around him Especially Anna and Freya

Kris throws a weekly banquet (a small get together where the entire village
joins for a round of drink brewed from sheep's milk and broth/Stew that Kris
cooks.)

During the banquet, Arnar comes up, bloodied and lacerated

Part 2: Kris heals Arnar this showcases that he has multiple skills. Anna is
hanging around Kris and Kris notices how Anna is looking at him, Kris concludes

Part 3: When Arnar wakes up, he tells him what has happened. He's attacked by a
group of Bandits while he was going to moonspire. With the money he had stolen.
Kris asks why did he steal the money and he replied he wanted to buy a staff
just like Kris'. Kris notices that Arnar worships Kris this makes him
uncomfortable. Kris tells the Snowdale villagers that he'll hunt these bandits
and bring them to justice.

Freya joins him on this mission as she argues that he'll need her skills as a
master huntswoman.  -->

*How long since I last slept?*  Kris tried to recall last time he had a sound
sleep, *Probably when I was in the office? Was I sleeping or was I lost in
work?* Kris leaned against the window sill and allowed the icy, gentle breeze
soothe him. *Should I go see Freya?* he fingered the flute, *What are you
thinking.* Outside, Abos - the broken moon rose above horizon and bathed the
snowy peaks of snowall mountains in a white glow.

"Kris!" someone knocked in a distinct pattern at his door and Kris smiled,
"Open the damn door!"

Kris wrapped a shirt around his torso, pocketed his metallic flute and opened
the door with a confused smile, "Freya," he was glad to have some company,
"What are you doing here?"

Freya pushed him aside and dashed to the fireplace. Anna followed inside
wearing her jet black hair in a bun and wrapped in a fur jacket that he had
made himself, "Anna!" Kris hugged her and found Janna, Arnold and a few other
miners smiling and shivering outside the door. He waved them inside and closed
the door, "What are you guys doing here?" he wrapped his arm around Anna's
shoulders and leaned comfortably against her.

"We saw your lights on!" Freya said from near the fireplace, rubbing her hands
together.

"I know you haven't slept in fifteen days," Anna said taking sip of a clear
transparent liquid, "I thought you'd enjoy our company." Kris looked at her
with teary eyes, *She knows me so well.* he thought, "But mostly, we wanted to
hear you play flute and maybe an interesting story." Janna had pulled a chair
and was sharing a cigarette with Arnold. The miners, Arnold's friends, stared
at Janna and elbowed each other playfully.

"Go ahead," Freya called out, "play your damn flute for your little Anna!"

"Oi." Anna hugged Kris tightly, "Why are you taunting him?" 

"He never does anything for me," Freya said.

"Kris," Janna said puffing cigarette in front of her, "Why Kris? Why don't you
do anything for Freya?"

"Yes Kris," Arnold took the cigarette from Janna

"We know you love her!" Janna said winking. Kris looked at Freya and saw her
cheeks turn scarlet, "You can't stop..."

"Woah," Kris pulled his hands up defensively-- holding his flute, "I'll do
something for her as well. Do you want me to play the flute now?" he pressed
the cold metal against his lips.

Everyone fell silent. Janna extinguished the cigarette with her heels and Freya
put in more wood in the fire and it cackled against the comfortable silence in
the room. Kris sighed and a sweet melody dripped from the flute. The small
group moved side-to-side to the cresending melody. Anna took small sips from
the bottle and passed it around. Kris moved his fingers slowly along the length
and the soulful melody took a dark turn and swelled into a menacing medley. A
tear formed in Arnold's eyes and he wiped it off quickly before anyone could
notice. 

Kris kept his eyes from closing, *My past will comeback.* Freya tucked her
brown hair behind her small ears and caught Kris staring at her. She blushed
pink and looked away leaving a smile on his face, *Death will be hear soon.*
When he finally stopped, Arnold couldn't contain tears from bubbling in his
eyes, Anna looked lost and Freya didn't once look back at Kris after she caught
him staring.

"That was beautiful." Janna broke the silence and lit a cigarette, "You made
Arnold cry." she patted his back and laughed.

"Story time." Anna said and everyone nodded.

"Okay." Kris said handing his flute to Anna who played with it as Kris thought
for a good story to tell. He looked outside of the window and saw Broken pieces
of Abos glowing brightly. "How about a story about Abos the Broken moon?"

"Sounds interesting to me." Arnold said and Janna nodded. The miners looked
away when Janna gave them a scathing glare.

---

Ages ago, when the man had just discovered fire, when the continent was
different Abos was a Powerful King of the Sky. He ruled the night and he ruled
the day and everyone on the continent bent their knees in front of him. "Who
can defeat?" he would often ask his wife Abisa -- the daughter of the Sun. Abos
sat on his throne looking down at the men who discovered fire and saw a young,
virign woman walking through the forest with a stone knife in one hand and a
basket of fruits in the other.

Enchanted by her beauty, Abos the King of the Sky, got up from his throne and
descended the earth in a human form. He was tall, muscular, white and glowing,
"What is your name?" he asked the virgin woman.

"Emira." she said. Her eyes were dazed by his glowing form and she inched
closer in fascination. Abos stood there with his arms on his hips and his chin
raised in arrogance. When she approached he grabbed her by her waist and broke
the scared promise he made to Abisa, his wife. He lay with Emira in the forest
and made defiant love to her. The Sun saw Abos' defiance and saw tears
trickling down Abisa's eyes. 

When Abos returned to the sky, Abisa, accompanied by her father, entered Abos'
castle. Her eyes were swollen and her heart broken, "Why did you do this to
me?" she asked, her words drowned in her tears, "Why did you break your scared
promise?" 

"Because," Abos got to his feet and said in his hubris, "I can." 

Enraged by Abos' pride the Sun raised his hands and casted him into a big
spherical rock-- the moon that we see at night. 

"You laid with another," Abisa said swinging her Hammer-- the Ruin, "When I
loved you with all my heart!" Tears that trickled down her eyes turned into
Silver. She slammed Ruin on Abos' smooth, spherical contours and shattered him
into pieces. 

"I'll kill that woman." Abisa said furious with jealousy and descended the
Continent. And saw the Emira was dead, killed by Abos. From her belly, Abisa
heard the cackling of a child. Using the knife that lay on the ground, Abisa
ripped her belly and pulled a small, bronze skinned child whose eyes glowed
golden just like Abos. She took the child to the Sky and raised him as her own.
He came to be known as Vumir-- the Son of Abisa.

---

"I'm pretty sure that is not the story." Janna said puffing another cigarette
and passing it along to Arnold.

"Well," Kris said stretching his leg, "That's the original story, that's how
the old books have it." he looked at Freya who rested her head on her knees and
watched Kris with playfulness in her eyes. Kris smiled and Freya blushed
scarlet.

"That was fun Kris!" Anna said hugging him. Kris wrapped his hand around Anna's
shoulders and held her close. He could feel her cheerfulness coursing through
his veins he felt his sorrows wash away in her warmth. 

"Now," Kris said turning around and walking towards a small cabinet, "Let's
drink this fine wine." he said pulling out a mud jar from the cabinet and
carefully placing it in the center. Anna scavanged glasses for everyone from
the kitchen and helped Kris pour wine for everyone. Kris found a nice spot
close to the fire and smiled at Freya who delicately sipped wine from her
glass.

Anna gossiped with Janna and teased the miners for oogling obstinately. She
took the glass from Arnold's hands and emptied it in a single gulp. Kris
laughed at her cheerfulness, momentarily forgeting his past. He found Freya
holding his callused hands and blushing pink. Kris smiled at her and gave her a
soft hands a gentle squeeze. A slow, strained knock on the door, startled
everyone. Anna dropped the glass of wine on the floor, spilling the white
liquid. She got to her feet-- almost angrily-- and opened the door. 

"Kris!" she let out a panicked welp and Kris let go of Freya's soft hands and
ran towards her. Outside Arnar, Joan's son lay flat on the ground blood oozing
from multiple cuts on his torso. 

"They are coming." he strained.

---

Kris wiped his brow with back of his hand and concentrated on cleaning the
blade wound. "Anna." Kris said looking up to find Anna standing opposite him
and watching Arnar with a tearful eye

"He'll survive," Anna asked with fear ladden voice, "Kris."

Kris poured some more alcohol and dabbed the wound with a cloth that stained
red, "He'll." he said and went to the fire place and placed his flute deep
inside the clacking fire and returned to find Anna's eyes dripping big tear
drops down both the cheeks. He embraced the little girl and kissed her
forehead, "You love him, right?" 

Anna remained silent and Kris slowly led her out of the door, "Freya." he
called out and she dashed towards him, blushing scarlet, "Take care of Anna."
and closed the door behind. 

*Who are coming?* Kris thought as he stared at the fire dancing fire, *Why
would someone attack Arnar?* Kris scratched his chin and wondered how Arnar had
come stumbling to the village covered in multiple cuts on his torso. He glanced
towards him and saw blood slowly oozing from the wounds. *He couldn't be far
from the village.* Kris turned to see his flute burning red hot. He grabbed the
flute with his barehands, his skin sizzled and burned under the red hot flute. 

He carefully cauterized Arnar's wound who jolted conscious and screamed. Kris
placed his free hand on Arnar's mouth and supressed his agonizing pain, "What
are you doing?" Anna flunged the door open and asked angrily, "You'll kill
him." Kris ignored Anna's protests and continued to cauterize Arnar's wounds
one by one. When done he threw the flute in a bucket filled with water and
submerged his callused hands in the ice cold water.

"That," Kris said wiping his hands on his trousers and walking towards Anna,
"Will seal the open wounds and stop the blood loss." He hugged Anna and guided
her out of the door and into the snowy field. A cold wind had gathered speed
and was blowing from the mountains. *She'll get cold.* he thought as he hugged
Anna in a tighter embrace.

"Aren't you cold?" Janna asked pulling in a drag of smoke from the cigarette
and shivering against the cold wind, "You are just wearing a shirt." she
pointed at his loose white shirt.

Kris smiled and ignored her, "Call Joan." he ordered Janna who extinguished the
butt of the cigarette and turned into an alley just a few steps away. 

"Arnold," he turned to find Arnold smoking a cigarette, "You call every officer
here right now. Where did the miners go?" 

"They went for a leak." Arnold pointed to his back.

"We need to protect the mines," Kris handed Anna to Freya and scratched his
head, "We need to protect Snowdale." *I cannot lose them.* he thought.
"Everyone who can fight should be here within one hour."  Arnold nodded and
left in Miners direction. Kris turned to Freya who was soothing a shocked Anna.
*She looks so beautiful right now.* 

Kris started towards them when Arnar screamed in agony and Anna broke free and
rushed inside.

"She's in love with him." Freya said holding Kris' callused hands.

*Everytime I fall in love.* Kris thought sighing, *Death follows.*

	  who took Anna. Freya follows.  This begins Kris's Journey through the
Continent to find it in ruins!  -->

*This silence...* Kris thought looking towards Anna and Freya, *Please break
this silence.* Over an hour had passed since Kris sent Arnold away. "Where's
Janna?" he spoke to himself to break the heavy silence that lingered in the
room.

"She'll be here." Freya said warming herself next to the fireplace. She held
Anna in a soothing embrace who hadn't spoken a word. *What's going inside her
head?* Kris started towards her.

"Hey," Kris said holding Anna by her shoulders, "Are you okay?" 

Anna raised her gaze and smiled at Kris, "I'm fine." she said taking the jacket
off and handing it to Freya who felt a chill settle inside her, "If Arnar was
attacked..." Anna thought for a moment, "The attackers should be close by."

"Yes." Kris got to his feet and fingered the flute, "We need to protect the
Deposits."

"Do you think they are after the deposits?"

Kris looked outside the window and watched Abos make it's final descent beyond
the horizon, "Yes." he said softly. *It's the only valuable thing in this
village.* he thought to himself, *How did they find our location?* Kris
thought. *I've made sure the spies don't find us.* 

"Kris." Janna knocked loudly and broke Kris' chain of thought.

"What to you so long?" Kris looked at stooped Joan covered in multiple layers
of warm clothing following Janna with a walking stick and shrugged, "Get in.
Quickly now."

"How's my son?" Joan asked trying to walk as fast as she could.

"He's well." Kris said lifting Joan in his arms and taking her to the Arnar.
Joan fell on Arnar's chest and broke down-- sobbing uncontrollably.

"Why?" Joan said slapping Arnar across his face, "Why did you steal all the
money?"

"I wanted to buy a staff." Arnar said looking towards Kris with reverent eyes,
"A staff just like Kris's. I want to be as strong as he is." *He worships me.*
A stone churned inside his stomach and his heart fell heavier than a mountain,
*He worships me like a hero... I'm no hero... I'm... a Murderer.* Darkness
gathered inside his mind, and his voices of people long dead echoed. 

Anna tapped his shoulders and Kris saw Arnold waiting next to Janna, smoking a
cigarette and passing it back to her, "They are here." he said pointing towards
the door. Kris nodded and looked at Freya and centered himself in the present.

Kris found a small group of men and women armed with daggers and batons
shivering in the morning cold. Kris scanned the men and made a note for
himself, *I should have trained a few swordsmen...*

"Why did you call us Kris?" a middle aged man with broad shoulders and matted
hair said in rasping voice.

"A threat looms on Snowdale..." Kris paused, and searched for cautious words.

"Well, it's almost winter," a scar faced man said in a heavy voice, "It's
particularly chilly this time. We may not have enough harvest."

"Silence." Janna ordered from behind Kris. *I can always count on her to
discipline them.* 

"A threat far greater than a cold winter." Kris said, "A threat that can kill
us. That can wreak havoc on the continent."

"We don't care about the continent." someone said from behind, "We are the
outcasts that no one wanted."

"A broken continent would risk our existence." Kris said calmly, "This threat
would make us a target."

"We don't have to worry," a old woman with a baton resting on her shoulders
said, "You can protect us."

*These people...* thoughts of his bloody past tried to surface and Kris
suppressed them, "We can prevent this..." Kris looked at Freya and her smiling
face soothed his anxiety.

"What is this threat?"

"Arnar was attacked..." Kris said, "The attackers are close to the village, and
they are no ordinary brigands, they are armed with sharp blades.

"We must protect the vumirium deposits and the mines. They should not be taken
from us. It is ours and should remain that way." *If Vumirium falls into wrong
hands...* Kris shook his head lightly.

"What do you want us to do?" Janna asked from behind, shouldering her baton.

Kris nodded, "Janna, you and Arnold, take these soldiers and secure the
Deposits."

"You said the attackers are armed with blades..." Janna paused looking at her
baton, "How can we fight them with..."

"Batons hold up against blades." Kris went inside the room and returned with an
unsheathed sword. Everyone exchanged looks and gasped at the shining blade,
"Take your defensive stance..." Kris ordered Janna and he slashed his sword
over his head and it slide against the smooth wood of baton.

"Batons are great for defense..." Kris said, "Mind your head and you'll do just
fine.

"I'll need a scout who can signal us when the enemy is near, Kaylor..."

"No." Freya said, "I'll be the scout."

"Are you sure?" Kris raised an eyebrow. *She burns everything. She's sloppy.
Can she do it? Well she did hunt for you!*

"Yes!" Freya said folding her arms under her bosom. Kris looked at her and
nodded in approval.

"Everyone else... need to stay inside their houses." *I cannot lose Anna.*
"Anna you'll come with me to the mines."


"No." Anna stood her ground, "I'll stay with Arnar. He'll need some protect."
Kris looked at her with raised eyebrow and saw Freya smiling from the corner of
his eyes.

*She'll be okay.* Freya mouthed and Kris nodded and sheathed the blade and
handed it to her, "Anna, this is a very special sword with a long history. It
has never lost a battle. Keep this with you, it'll protect you."

"Does it have a name?" Anna asked unsheathing the sword a little, "Why is
special?"

"It's called Sorrow." Kris said placing a hand on her shoulders, "For your
other question, you'll have to wait till this is over." 

Kris turned around and dismissed everyone to their stations. Freya stood next
to him holding his hands, "We'll win this." Freya said in soft, comforting
voice. A single strand of her brown hair had gotten free form her braid and
gently fell across her face. Kris looked at her over his shoulders and thought,
*She looks so beautiful in the morning Sun. I'm definitely, hopelessly in
love.* he shook his head and steeled himself, *Doom's here.* 

---

A gentle wind from the Snowall and a soft glowing sun above the horizon in the
east greeted Kris when he arrived at the Mines, "Everyone!" he called out as
soon as he entered the mine office. 

"Get out of here! Now!" he looked for the supervisor who hurried to meet him,
"What is your name, girl?" Kris asked in a flat, commanding voice.

"People here call me Gilly," Gilly blushed, "I'm the best..." 

"I don't have time to listen to your stories, Gilly. We are under attack, get
everyone out of the mines, now." 

"Sir," Gilly said with a confused look, "We'll not be able to meet our targets
sir, if I dismiss the miners, sir!" 

"Gilly, What is more important my dear girl? Safety of your Miners or your
Target?"

"Safety sir!" Gilly looked down at her feet, "Where should I take them sir?"

Kris raised her head by placing a finger under her chin, "Take them to the
Mountains and wait for my signal before you bring them down." he gave her a
gentle kiss on her forehead, "I can trust you Gilly?"

Gilly blushed pink by Kris's act of kindness and he saw a iron resolve form
inside her eyes, "Yes sir!"

Kris nodded and dismissed the girl. He looked around the Mine Office and found
himself a wooden chair. He picked it up and brought it outside in the open sun.
Around him, panicked Miners and officers followed Gilly's orders. *She's a
brave girl.* he noted at her skills in leading the miners and the officers and
keeping their panic away.

"This way!" Gilly pointed towards the east, towards the Snowall mountains, "We
are going to the Mountains everyone."

The sun slowly raised the thin veil of fog that had settled over the valley and
Kris felt the heat warming him up. He sat crossed legged and waited for every
last one of his miners to leave. *Maybe I should play some flute for them...*
he pulled his flute out of his pocket and placed it on his lips, *Now, what
should I play?* he thought, *Maybe something uplifting.* he smiled to himself
and began playing a thunderous melody that uplifted the spirits. Kris could
hear people humming and clapping and tapping as the continued to trickle out of
the mine gate towards the Snowall Mountains.

"Sir!" Gilly came up to him and broke him off his melody, "Everyone's out! Will
you be alright sir?"

Kris smiled as he pocketed his flute and said in a calm, soothing voice, "I'll
be!"

Gilly nodded to him and Kris saw her leave the compound, *Brave little girl.*
he thought to himself as he watched her disappear in the woods at the foothill.
He turned the other way and looked at the southern horizon for any signal from
Freya.*Nothing yet!*

He undid his cloak and took his shirt and felt the silent wind tickle his
scarred torso. He closed his eyes and calmed himself by focusing on his
breathing, *Breath in... Breath out.* The silent wind wisphered the chattering
of his miners from the woods. Kris heard a river flowing somewhere and marching
footsteps from south, *They'll be here soon.* he thought slowly as he continued
to enhance his senses. He heard quiet, nervous whispers of Janna and Arnold and
smelled fear lingering in the air around Snowdale. 

When he opened his eyes, he saw the it. In the distance, a smoke pillar curved
its way up towards the blue sky. His eyes glistened with a bloodlust and he
wrapped his fingers around his staff and lowered himself into an attacking
stance *The Tiger Stance* he had named it, as it was the most devastating. Kris
slowly moved his body and practiced his moves. A layer of trickling sweat
covered his scarred torso and his breathing steadily gained speed. 

Kris flowed from the Tiger to the Turtle Stance with ease and practiced his
defenses, *They'll not know what hit them...* he thought as he continued to
swing the staff-- that slowly felt heavy-- over his head. Kris heard something,
a twig cracking and leaves crumbling in the distance and he turned towards the
source. He narrowed his eyes and saw Freya running frantically through the
woods gazing over her shoulders.

*Hmm* he shook his head and continued to practice his movements. For the
moment, his head was clear and free of Freya's thought. *I'll rip them all
apart.* he thought to himself, placing the staff over his shoulders and
catching a quick breath. His eyes were fixed in the distance, towards Freya.
*It's been a long time.* he smiled with darkness veiling his unusually focused
eyes, *It's been a long time since I've been in a fight.* 

"Kris." Freya screamed when she was within a shouting distance, "They are hear,
a group broke free and..." she gazed over her shoulders and dashed towards him.
Kris got to his feet and calmed himself down, *This is going to be...* he
thought with an evil smile, *Fun.* 

"They are way too many for you to fight alone." Freya said catching her breath,
"Atleast 20 people are coming."

Kris gave her a side ways glanced and continued to focus in the direction Freya
returned from. A group of 20 men dressed in olive green uniform marched in
perfect synchrony, "I'm their Horror." he said calmly. The 20 men saw him and
charged at full speed surrounding him. *Impossible.* Kris thought when he
looked at the crest on their uniform, *It is not possible. They...* he thought
as he looked at the men surrounding the duo. 

"Who are you?" A man, who looked like their captain spoke in a firm voice,
"Surrender and we'll not harm you."

"That crest..." words mumbled out of his mouth, "It can't be." Kris looked at
the men and their weapons. *These are no men.* he thought, *That ain't steel.*
he looked at their weapons that gave a faint blue tint. 

"Who are you?" the man asked indicating one of his men to capture them. A
soldier from Kris' right marched towards him and before he could grab Kris's
shoulders Kris attacked-- cracking open the man's skull with one blow of his
staff.

"I'm your Horror." Kris replied to the captain and swung coaxed his enemy to
attack. The men charged, all at once, in a cordinated manner. Kris moved as he
had practiced and cracked open skulls and dislocating jaws and snapping necks
with his staff, avoiding the sharp blue blade. *Stay away from that blade.* he
thought as he snapped another neck, *Kill them all before they land a blow.*
Kris saw someone approach from the corner of his eye and he raised his staff to
defense but the sword cleanly cut through the staff. Kris stumbled as his staff
broke into two pieces.

Steadying himself he pulled out his flute and impaled the attacker. He dodged
an incoming blow from his left and swung half staff in a furious circle
cracking open the attacker's skull. He looked at the captain who swallowed as
one by one his men collapsed. When the last man fell at Kris's feet, his head
lolling the Captain stumbled back and tried to escape.

"That crest." Kris said grabbing the captain by his throat, "Who are you?"

"We are the 122nd Unit of 5th Legion of the Elven Star."

"Elven Star." Freya repeated from behind Kris and Kris saw her walk calmly
through the field of corpses, "Never heard of them."

Kris looked at her with fury and choked the man to his death. Freya swallowed,
terrified by seeing malice and darkness lurking behind his eyes. Kris closed
his eyes and closed a door inside his mind. When he opened his eyes he saw
corpses all around and Freya standing bravely amongst them. *She's...* Kris
thought as he crumbled to his knees. *She's seen the darkness. And she's
terrified.* 

"Hey." Freya said wrapping her arms around his neck and caressing his hair,
"You were amazing."

Kris pushed tears back and looked up at her, "You think?"

"Yes." Freya looked around and counted, "You killed 23 men all by yourself."

"They are not men!"

"What? What do you mean?" Freya looked at the corpses closely, "I don't see any
different about them."

*You don't know so much about the past.* Kris thought as he got to his and
gazed towards the Village. "Ana!" he called out with worry and dashed towards
the village engulfed in dancing golden flames.

## Chapter 5

<!-- Part 1: Kris looks around the village and sees the destruction. People,
fighters or civilians lay on the ground injured. Kris is afraid. He's afraid to
see Ana injured or worse, gravely injured. Kris finds Janna and Arnold cut up
badly their batons chipped.i 

Part 2: Kris searches for Ana, but is unable to find her. Arnar, the boy who
looked up to kris is dead. A dagger pierced through his heart. Joan has her
throat sliced.  Kris madly searches for Ana but she's nowhere to be found.
Freya, who's at his side tells him to fix Janna and Arnold who were the worst
hit.  Kris mindlessy ties lacerates their wounds and ties bandages. Freya talks
to people and finds out that Ana was taken. Kris breaks down and doesn't know
what to do. Freya picks him up and coax him to find Ana before anything
happens.

Part 3: Kris prepares to leave Snowdale in search of Ana. He visits Janna and
Arnold and appoint them as the interim leaders of the village. Gilly is made
incharge of the mining operations as Kris rememebers to reward her skills.
Freya joins Kris in his quest and the duo make their way out of the Snowdale
towards Moonspire the closest and the largest city near Snowdale.

Important things to note: 
	1. Kris often visits Moonspire to sell off extracted Vumirium
	2. The villagers have never visited the city because of treacherous
	   journey. The Journey takes 7 days and the traveller needs to walk
through the mountainous terrain of Snowall mountain. Snowdale sits in a valley!
	3. How was it settled? Snowdale was a bandits valley. Kris arrived and
	   brought order to the valley. 
	4. Janna, Arnold were born in the village. Kris brought Freya and her
	   father into the village on his way back from Moonspire. Everyone has
noticed that Kris doesn't age. Ana was found in the mean streets of Moonspire
when she was a girl of 8 (Apparently she was trained as a spy at a very early
age in Ana's arc we'll explore how Ana was made a spy and what she was doing in
Moonspire.)	

Part 4: Kris' discovery of Snowdale, his fight with the bandit gang, the death
of Bandit leader and formation of Snowdale -->

Kris felt the heat from the raging flames on his face. He reached for Freya's
hands and grasped them tightly in his. *No. No. No.* he thought with panic, *I
should have fought them outside.* He broke into a sprint and snaked his way
through the streets of Snowdale. 

All around him his people lay broken. Some had lost an eye and others were
bleeding from the ears as a blade-- the blue blade-- cut through the muscle
cleanly. A few of his miners writhed in pain from the burn scars that they had
sustained.

"What happened?" Freya said in a soothing voice that did not comfort him.

"They all..." Kris tried to find the right words, "This all happened because of
me!"

Freya inched closer to him and ran her soft hands along his cheeks and said in
a soft, comforting pitch, "You didn't do this, Kris. The 5th Legion did." Tears
formed in his eyes and grabbed Freya's hands, *I was not competent.* he wanted
to say but no voice come out.

"Let's find Ana!" Freya reminded him about the little girl he loved to bring
him back from his sorrow.

"Ana!" Kris steeled his mind and pushed the overwhelming pain he felt away and
dashed towards his house. *I shouldn't have left her behind. I was focused on
the mines and I made mistakes.*

"Freya," Kris stopped and turned around, "What if..." a teardrop formed in her
eyes, "What if Ana's injured?" he tried to keep the image of a lacerated, burnt
Ana away from his mind, "What if she's dead?"

Freya embraced him in a warm hug and helped strengthen his resolve, "If that
happens," she gave him a gentle kiss on his forehead, "They'll see Kris' fury.
Don't worry, you have given her a sword! Our little Ana is smart enough to
defend herself!"

"I..." Kris choked and Freya held him in her arms. He wiped the tears that
welled in his eyes and continued to wind down the street. The smell of ash and
charred hair filled the air and Kris' heart with extruciating pain. Kris
stopped again and held his heart, *All this... All this destruction... This
death...* his eyes lost their focus.

"Kris."  Freya's voice brought him back to reality and he found himself
standing in front of the deposits.

Kris looked around and found Janna and Arnold, sharing a cigarette, their
bodies lacerated and their wounds oozing a stream of blood, *How can they be
sharing a moment like that?* Kris thought as he approached the two.

"Kris." Janna said holding her neck with one hand and a cigarette with another,
"We couldn't..." she tried to complete her sentence but pain flooded her
senses.

"We couldn't protect the deposits." Arnold took the cigarette from Janna took a
deep puff. Kris glared at them and took the cigarette from his hands and
crushed it on the ground.

"Where's Ana?" Kris asked. His heart thumped nervously against his chest as he
waited for their answers. His mind raced away quickly and flashed visions of
Ana's corpse. 

"We..." Janna tried to speak up, "We don't know."

*No. No. No.* his mind escaped his control, *I've lost her. I've lost another.
I should have brought he with me. I should have fought them before they could
pillage the village. I should have equipped them better. I should have trained
them better... Ana.*

"Kris." Freya placed her soft hands on his shoulders and pulled him back from
his grief once again, "You need to treat them."

"But..." Kris looked at his hands, "Ana..."

"Ill go look for her." Freya said squeezing her hands, "You treat their
wounds!" Kris looked at Janna and Arnold bleeding to their death and he wiped
the tears from his eyes and found courage once again.

---

Kris had cleaned the wound and gave them a strong anesthetic derived from tree
bark. Aitken a small boy had come to help Kris upon Freya's request and Kris
ordered the little boy to make the antispetic paste.

Kris had started a small fire in the makeshift hospice and had placed his flute
to in the burning wood, "Where should I place them?" Ricky a miner who had
disappeared in the mountain with Gilly pointed at the injured villagers who
were too weak to move or were unconscious.

"There!" Kris pointed towards a cloth spread by the window, "I'll need more
people to make the antiseptic paste, Aitken will teach them how." Ricky nodded
and left. A few moments later Gilly appeared with a small group of miners and
officers and Aitken showed them the process. 

*Save them,* Kris maintained focus on treating the injured, *Janna and Arnold
are indispensible.* 

The fire had raged and turned the flute red-hot, Kris picked it with open hands
and cauterized the wounds that Janna and Arnold had sustained. Kris looked
around and saw Gilly staring at him with open mouth.

"I'm insensitive to heat." Kris said as he placed the flute back into the fire.

"Sir," Gilly approached him, "How can I be of help?"

*Ana.* Kris thought, *Should I send her looking for Ana? No!* "Go around the
village and prepare a detailed report about the damage." Gilly nodded, "I want
someone who can help me with this, send for the mines doctor."

"Okay." Gilly gave him a quick hug and left him with the a team of untrained
men and women creating antiseptic paste. 

"Sir," Aitken said, "Does this look good?" Kris walked towards him and looked
at the consistency of the paste that he had made. *It's not perfect. But it's
not bad!* 

"This is good!" Kris said, "Come with me!" he ordered the boy, "Bring the
paste."

Kris stood next to Janna how was in a state of comatose and took the bowl of
paste from Aitken who stood opposite him, "Now," Kris said digging his fingers
into the bowl, "I'm going to teach you how to apply antiseptic paste. When you
understand this, I want you to take a couple of them outside and treat anyone
who's only mildly injured. Do you understand?" The boy nodded and Kris
continued to walk him through the methodology of treating injuries with
Antiseptic.

"Always make sure you've cleaned the wounds," Kris said, "Do you understand?"

"Keep the paste should form a thin layer on the wound." Kris explained, "This
will make the wound breathe air and heal faster. Do you understand?" 

"Take this, apply it over here!" he asked the little boy to show what he had
learned. *Good! He can become a fine doctor.* 

"Kris?" an old man with balding head an unkempt beard walked in through the
door, "Gilly sent me!"

"I'll need you to start treating that batch!" he pointed towards the patients
who were lying unconscious on the floor by the window, "I hope you know what to
do!" the doctor nodded and got to his work, "When you need to cauterize th
wound, call me!"

"Kris!" Freya had walked in through the door Kris' felt fear wrap his mind.

Kris looked at Freya's beautiful form and for a moment he forgot about his
worries, "Did you find her?"

"Kris," Freya held his hands in hers, "You did a great job, you did everything
you could..."

"No." Kri said, "She can't be dead!"

"No," Freya calmed him, "She was taken by the Legion." *No. No. No...* Kris
thought as he crumbled to the ground, his men, his soldiers looked at him with
anxiety and worry, *I lost her. I shouldn't have fallen in Love.* he looked at
Freya and a part of him smiled.

"I lost her." Kris thought, "I lost my little Ana."

"Kris," Freya ran her fingers through his black, matted hair, "You need keep
yourself together. We need to find her and bring her back. She's not lost,
Kris, till you give up! You are Kris.You are their Horror."

"No!" Kris thought, "I can't be! I can't be that person."

"Kris," Freya said in a soothing yet commanding voice, "We need to bring your
little Ana back!"

"What should I do?"

"Let's head out! Let us find them." Freya held his cheeks between her palms,
"I'm a good hunter. We can track them down and we can recover Ana."

Kris found Arnar's body lying on the bed with a sword jutting through his
chest. *They killed him as well.* Kris thought as he tried to keep tears from
welling in his eyes, *He died idealizing me... I couldn't even project him.*
Kris pulled the flute from his pocket played a lamenting melody to mourne,
Arnar and Joan's death. 

By the time the melody crescendoed, Freya had come with a a bag hanging on her
back and a staff that she had fashioned out of a relatively straight branch.
Kris wiped the small droplets of tears that had formed in his eyes and gave
Freya a sad smile, *I couldn't protect them...* He thought as he mindlessly
packed hard bread, apples and some salt and pepper in his bag. He looked around
and pulled the sword free Arnar's chest and wrapped it in leather sheet. 

"You should call someone perform the final rituals." Freya told Kris in a
soothing voice from her favorite place by the hearth. Kris nodded and went out
to call a miner named Hark.

"Were you friends with Arnar?" Kris asked Hark as he walked in through the
door. He shook his head as Kris led him towards the blood-drenched body, "Do
you know someone who were friends with him?" 

"Yes!" Hark nodded. Kris heard Hark's stomach churn.

"Good! Find them." Kris looked at Freya who was getting up on her feet. He
looked around the house and gave it one final look, "Give him proper farewell."
Kris handed the keys of his door to Hark and the three left in silence. Kris
found Gilly organizing the men and ordering them around.

"Gilly," a young miner walked up to her, "We've found another! He was trapped
inside his house as it burned."

"Why are you telling me that?" Gilly said angrily, "Get that man to the
infirmary. Ricky, Inform the doctor about this man, now!"

*She's a natural.* Kris thought as he walked up to her, *I can leave the
village in her hands.*

"Sir!" Gilly blushed pink and stood up straight. Her eyes moved to avoid gazing
into Kris' passion filled eyes.

"Gilly," Kris said putting an arm around her shoulders, *I need to show a calm
face. I need to show strength.* "I'm going to find those who took my little
Ana." Kris placed a finger under her chin and raised her head, "Here's what you
are going to do!

"I want you to take care of the mining operations, get the mines up and
running. There can be more attacks while I'm away, I want you to find strong
willed men who can take up arms. And make them work extra hard in the mines. I
want them to build their physique. There are a bunch of swords in the mine
compound, send someone and bring them back to the Deposits."

"Sir, I can make the work extra hard in mines, but we don't know how to handle
the swords."

"Look out for someone named Maya. I'll be sending her to train soldiers. Tell
the doctor to treat Janna and Arnold with extra attention. I want them to be
trained in Swords." Kris looked at Gilly's eager eyes, *Should I tell her about
smelting weapons?* Kris thought for a moment, *No.* 

"Anything else sir?" Gilly asked.

"You are doing a good job Gilly. I'm impressed." He pulled Gilly in an embrace
and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead, "I make you interim Head of
Snowdale."

"You think she can do it?" Freya asked as the two crossed the edges of the
Snowdale village into the icy wilderness of the north

"We'll find out!" Kris gave a small, hopeful smile.

The wagon jolted Kris from his sleep as it rolled to a sudden stop. The mule
that pulled the wagon lathered and refused to continue, "Let's stop." The
merchant who drove the wagon said in an annoyed voice.

Kris stopped stretching when he realised Freya was resting her head on his
shoulders. *She looks...* Kris thought as his heart skipped a beat, *Absolutely
beautiful.* He tucked a loose strand of her brown hair behind her ears and
caressed her soft cheeks, "Freya..." he said softly.

She groaned and slowly woke up, "Are we there yet?" Freya looked confused, "How
long have I slept?" she looked around, "Last I remember we were a few days out
of Snowdale..." Kris looked at her with astonishment and laughed out loud.

"That was a week back!" Kris said getting out of the wagon and stretching his
legs, "We are a day or so away from Moonspire."

"Kris!" the merchant called from head of the caravan. 

"I'll be right back," Kris said breaking a knuckle. He strode towards the head
of the caravan and waited patiently for the merchant to finish watering the
tired mules. Kris twisted his face with irritation and regretted having hitched
a ride to Moonspire for Freya and himself. *She was tired of walking...* Kris
thought to himself as he watched the pot bellied merchant feed the mules.

"Pay up." the merchant put on of his hand forward and the other on his hips.
Kris sighed and pulled out a small Vumirium coin from his pocket and handed it
to him. 

The merchant bit the coin and licked it to examine the authenticity of the
coin. *He doesn't even know how to test Vumirium...* Kris sighed and waited for
the merchant to pocket it. "Looks good to me! Who are you again? How did you
find Vumirium?"

"Does it matter?" Kris said turning on his heels and walking towards Freya who
had just dropped out of the wagon and was stretching her legs. 

"I don't want any trouble," the merchant said from behind, "Find food for the
caravan." *I'm not your servant...* Kris was about to blurt out but he let his
anger evaporate and raised his thumb in acknowledgement.

"I don't like him." Freya said as Kris approached. Around them the servants and
employees that the pot bellied merchant had hired were setting up camp. He
could hear children cackling and twigs cracking. A couple of merchants took
giggling whores away from the camp into the darkness of the forest that
surrounded them. 

Kris noticed a heavy-set mercanary eyeing Freya, *I dare you touch her.* he
thought as came to stop right in front of her, "I don't like the lot."

"I'm hungry." Freya said rubbing her belly, "It's getting cold." Kris took his
dark black cloak off and handed it to Freya. The cold wind prickled his torso
and calmed him. *Ana,* he thought, *I'm coming...* 

"Let's go!" Freya called from the northen edge of the camp and Kris joined her.
The cackling of children, the sound of swords rattling and whores moaning
erotically slowly disappeared. Kris' eyed adjusted to the encompassing
darkness. Kris looked up the see purple slowly pushing the orange out of the
sky. 

"It'll be night soon." Kris said.

"I know!" Freya said as she let an arrow loose, "Found game already."

*She's terrifying.* Kris thought as watched Freya observe her surroundings for
a brief moment before loosing another arrow. *She's...* Kris stopped his
thought before it could form and shifted his focus back on retrieving Ana.

"Will she be alright?" Kris said loudly.

"Ana?" Freya retrieved the kill and continued to walk deeper into the forest.
"Ofcourse! She's a strong girl."

*I hope they don't ...* Kri shook his head to let the ugly thought disappear,
"I'll burn this whole world down..." he muttered incomprehensively.

"We'll find her soon!" Freya said as she shot a small rabbit racing towards it
burrow. Something moved in the corner of his eyes and Kris picked up a long,
branch from the ground, "What is it?" Freya asked.

"Someone's following us." Kris whispered almost inaudibly. 

"Do you think the merchant..."

"Yes!" Kris thought as he tighened his grip around the makeshift shaft, "He
wants the vumirium."

A twig cracked and then another. Whoever was following approached without
making any attempt to conceal their presence. Kris relaxed himself, *No... I
cannot. It'll take time...* Someone giggled and the mercenary who was eyeing
Freya broke out from the darkness of the woods with a giggling, naked whore.

"Seems like this is occupied." the whore chuckled. Kris looked over his
shoulders and found Freya blushing pink.

The mercenary looked at Freya with lust and the disappeared back into the woods
with the woman. 

"Let's go." Freya said holding 4 large game in her hands.Kris took them from
her and together they walked back towards the camp the merchant had quickly
setup. He handed the game to the caravan cook who thanked them for their
services. *What a nice fellow.* Kris thought and found Freya still blushing
pink.

---

"That was delicious!" Freya told chewing the final pieces of the food the cook had served. Kris agreed as he dumped the bones in the ground and got up to stretch his legs. The gentle breeze that flowed through the thicket chilled him and he wrapped his jacket around him. *It is getting cold...* he thought. He looked at Freya and smiled inside for a brief moment. 

"We'll leave at the break of dawn." The merchant told as he drank water from his skin and passed it around, "Marco." he looked around. The mercanary who had been eyeing Freya, a man with barrel shaped chest and a scar running across his cheeks broke free from th whore and waited for his ordered. "You'll be on the guard duty tonight." the merchant said. 

"Let's go!" Kris offered his hands to Freya and pulled her up to her feet. Kris saw her turn pink at the simple gesture. *She's just so...* Kris tried to find a word that described Freya but failed, *Special.*

He led Freya through the camp and into the woods. Crickets chirped and a snake slithered somewhere close. Kris allowed his eyes to adjust to the darkness and found Freya stumbling behind him. He held her shoulders and steadied her as he led her through the woods. 

"What are you trying to do Kris?" she asked. Kris felt her blushing in the dark. *That is not what... Oh never mind.* he thought to himself.

"Tonight," Kris said as he took of his cloak and wrapped it around Freya. He found an almost straight branch and started whittling it down with a knife he had smuggled out of the camp. "Tonight, we'll be attacked! They want to steal the Vumirium."

"Why do you think it'll happen tonight?" Freya asked finding a stump to sit on.

"Think about it..." Kris examined the branch again, "We've been on guard duty every night. Why did the merchant order Marco to be the guard tonight?"

"Maybe," Freya said scratching her chin, "He's being nice to us!"

Kris looked up and chuckled, "You think?"

"Okay maybe he's  not being nice..." Freya shrugged, "But why does he want to steal Vumirium?"

"Freya, Honey," Freya blushed at being called honey, "Vumirium is precious... A single coin is worth a 1000 Moonspire Marks... That's about 100 times more that a gold coin of similar shape."

Kris noticed Freya's eyes widen and her jaw drop, "Really? Why?"

"There are so many reasons for Vumirium's worth," Kris began explaining, "First-- it is because of Vumirism. People have connected  this metal to Lord Vumir and the worth has sky rocketed. Second-- Vumirium has special metallurgical properties, it doesn't erode, it doesn't react or rust. It is extremely easy to work on and it retains lustre better than Gold and Silver-- that also explains why Vumirian Church has associated the metal to Lord Vumir.

"It is believed that Lord Vumir had mined the metal himself and casted a Vumirium goblet-- The one they have kept in the Vumirian Church-- and a ring that he gave to the King of Vumiria.

"Lastly-- the worth of Vumirium is in it's supply. Majority of Vumirium in circulation had been mined over a thousand years ago, during the time of Lord Vumir himself. The extreme rarity of the metal has been the reason why it is so expensive."

"That explains why we were attacked."

"No. It doesn't." Kris explained, "No one knows that we mine Vumirium. No one knows about the size of our deposits. How did the attackers, the 5th Legion of the Elven Star know? Only a few merchants in the Moonspire Court know about me..." Kris heard someone approach. *He's being careful this time.* Kris smiled in the darkness and got to his feet and formed a shield in front of Freya.

"I'm not going to be much help." she whispered from behind, "I can barely see you." *That never occured... How can he see?* Kris thought as he waited for the mercanary to break into the glade.

Kris tightened his grip around the staff that he had carved and calmed himself, "Marco." Kris challenged the mercenary who slowly became visible. "You are going to be seriously handicapped here-- in this darkness." 

"Kristopher -- the Impaler." he called and Kris went stiff at being called the Impaler. *It has been a long time since I've been called the Impaler.* he thought.

"Who are you?" Kris asked with nervous energy. Marco circled the Kris and Freya and smiled.

"Did you forget already?" Marco pulled out a Blue Blade from it's scabbard, "You did this." he pointed at his scar with his Blade.

"It can't be!" Kris swallowed.

"You thought I died?" Marco gave a throaty laugh, "We are the same, Impaler."

"We are not!" Kris fell into an attacking stance and kept the staff in front of him, "You use that cursed blade."

"What about you Impaler?" Marco readied himself, "What about that cursed Flute? What about the Blood that stains your Flute? What about Riptide."

"That is my past." Kris steeled himself, "I've given up Riptide."

"You know where it is." Marco lowered himself in a weird stance, *Riptide.* Kris itched for the sword that he had buried a long time ago. A darkness formed in his heart a darkness that could enjoyed killing. *No. I'm not that person. Not anymore. I've Ana, I've Freya.*

"I'm going to kill you."

"Yes!" Marco said, "That is who you are. A killer. An Impaler."
